1.0.1: Internal release

- Fixed a bug in primeGen() that caused it to do strange things
  if the first number in the sieve passed.
- Fixed a memory leak in lbnExpMod
- Fixed bug in lbn80386.asm lbnModQ_32 (was a complete mess)
- Fixed bug in bnDoubleExpMod (one-character change)
- Fixed a bug in an out-of-memory case in lbnInv
- Added out-of-memory checking to bntest
- Installation documentation improved, especially for non-Unix platforms.
- Preprocessor trickery made compatible with some ancient sort-of-ANSI
  compilers.  To be precise:
  - Not liking "#if FOO" when FOO is not defined (ANSI says FOO is "0")
  - Not liking long constants without "l" (ANSI says all pp math is long)
- bnInit() made redundant; now called automatically by bnBegin().
- bnCmpQ(struct BigNum const *, unsigned) added.
- Removed copyright disclaimers from some files so as not to confuse things.
- Spell-checked, corrected and improved comments in lbn16.c.  Especially
  added a big description of Montgomery representation.
- Added parens a few places to shut up compiler warnings.
- Added 386 support for Unix and some GCC-specific inline assembler tricks.
- Got rid of some warnings in lbn8086.h.
- Improved PowerPC inline assembler for CodeWarrior 8.
