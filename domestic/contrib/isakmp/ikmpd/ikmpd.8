.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Cisco Systems, Inc. IKE distribution, version 0.8 
.Pp
This software distribution is a reference implementation of the
IETF's IKE protocol. This distribution is being made available free of
charge for any commercial or non-commercial use.
.Pp
The implementation is based upon ISAKMP draft number 9 [MSST98] and
the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) draft number 6 [HC98].
.Pp
Included with this distribution is a copy of a cryptographic
library from Cylink, Corporation. In order to promote ISAKMP and IKE, Cylink 
has granted Cisco the right to offer this library-- source code to the 
Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the Digital Signature Standard, and the Digital 
Encryption Standard-- to all third parties on a royalty-free basis for use 
only with this IKE reference implementation. This cryptographic library
is offered under the following license:

Corporation, holds exclusive sublicensing rights to the following U.S.
patents owned by the Leland Stanford Junior University:

.Pp
In order to promote the widespread use of these inventions from
Stanford University and adoption of the ISAKMP reference by the IETF
community, Cisco has acquired the right under its sublicense from Cylink to
offer the ISAKMP reference implementation to all third parties on a royalty
free basis.  This royalty free privilege is limited to use of the ISAKMP
reference implementation in accordance with proposed, pending or approved
IETF standards, and applies only when used with Diffie-Hellman key
exchange, the Digital Signature Standard, or any other public key
techniques which are publicly available for commercial use on a royalty
free basis.  Any use of the ISAKMP reference implementation which does not
satisfy these conditions and incorporates the practice of public key may
require a separate patent license to the Stanford Patents which must be
negotiated with Cylink's subsidiary, Caro-Kann Corporation."

The Cylink library uses Colin Plumb's BigNum multiprecision integer
math library which is covered by the following copyright:

.Pp
This daemon uses the PF_KEY Key Management API [MPA96] to register
with a kernel which has implemented this API and the surrounding key 
management infrastructure. The NRL IPsec software distribution (currently 
bundled with IPv6) is such an implementation. Note that the NRL January 96 
distribution must be patched with the patchfiles included in this release
*before* use with this ISAKMP implementation.
.Pp
The daemon fully functions with a BSD 4.4ish UNIX operating system 
to which the NRL code has been ported. Application requests for security 
generate key acquire requests to the ISAKMP daemon. Upon successful 
negotiation, a valid Security Association is inserted into the key engine, 
at which point packets from and/or to the application will be processed 
according to the attributes from the requested Security Association.
