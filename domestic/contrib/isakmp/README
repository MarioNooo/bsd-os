   Cisco Systems, Inc. IKE distribution, version 0.8 
  ----------------------------------------------------

	This software distribution is a reference implementation of the
IETF's IKE protocol. This distribution is being made available free of
charge for any commercial or non-commercial use.

	The implementation is based upon ISAKMP draft number 9 [MSST98] and
the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) draft number 6 [HC98].

	Included with this distribution is a copy of a cryptographic
library from Cylink, Corporation. In order to promote ISAKMP and IKE, Cylink 
has granted Cisco the right to offer this library-- source code to the 
Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the Digital Signature Standard, and the Digital 
Encryption Standard-- to all third parties on a royalty-free basis for use 
only with this IKE reference implementation. This cryptographic library
is offered under the following license:

        "Cylink Corporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary Caro-Kann
Corporation, holds exclusive sublicensing rights to the following U.S.
patents owned by the Leland Stanford Junior University:
 
        Cryptographic Apparatus and Method
        ("Hellman-Diffie") .................................. No. 4,200,770
 
        Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus
        and Method ("Hellman-Merkle") .................. No. 4,218, 582
 
        In order to promote the widespread use of these inventions from
Stanford University and adoption of the ISAKMP reference by the IETF
community, Cisco has acquired the right under its sublicense from Cylink to
offer the ISAKMP reference implementation to all third parties on a royalty
free basis.  This royalty free privilege is limited to use of the ISAKMP
reference implementation in accordance with proposed, pending or approved
IETF standards, and applies only when used with Diffie-Hellman key
exchange, the Digital Signature Standard, or any other public key
techniques which are publicly available for commercial use on a royalty
free basis.  Any use of the ISAKMP reference implementation which does not
satisfy these conditions and incorporates the practice of public key may
require a separate patent license to the Stanford Patents which must be
negotiated with Cylink's subsidiary, Caro-Kann Corporation."

	The Cylink library uses Colin Plumb's BigNum multiprecision integer
math library which is covered by the following copyright:

and is subject to licensing terms in the included LICENSE file.

	This daemon uses the PF_KEY Key Management API [MPA96] to register
with a kernel which has implemented this API and the surrounding key 
management infrastructure. The NRL IPsec software distribution (currently 
bundled with IPv6) is such an implementation. Note that the NRL January 96 
distribution must be patched with the patchfiles included in this release
*before* use with this ISAKMP implementation.

	The daemon fully functions with a BSD 4.4ish UNIX operating system 
to which the NRL code has been ported. Application requests for security 
generate key acquire requests to the ISAKMP daemon. Upon successful 
negotiation, a valid Security Association is inserted into the key engine, 
at which point packets from and/or to the application will be processed 
according to the attributes from the requested Security Association. 

   Code Overview
   -------------

    - cylink		cryptographic library (D-H, SHA, DES, DSS).
    - doc		documentation on use of this distribution.
    - ikmpd		the actual ISAKMP daemon.
    - auth		authentication library and key ring management
			utilities.

	The ikmpd directory contains modules for each payload type. These
contain "process" and "construct" routines which are invoked as the
payload is parsed. The auth directory contains a suite of routines for the
creation and manipulation of DSS public/private keys and pre-shared keys. 
A library also exists for the creation of new routines. The doc directory 
contains documentation on use of this distribution. It is recommended to 
read this documentation before attempting to compile or use this package.

	If this release is used soley for non-commercial purposes it can
be compiled with RSAREF. Compiler flags in auth/Makefile and ikmpd/Makefile
selectively compile code to do authentication methods of RSA encryption, and 
RSA signatures, and create and manage RSA key rings.

   Security
   --------

	cisco System's ISAKMP daemon is a reference implementation and
it should not be assumed to provide any level of security.

	This distribution, coupled with the NRL distribution, provides
end-to-end IP-layer security without the burden of manually pre-keyed
Security Associations. It is, though, susceptible to well-known attacks:

	* Since the daemon only uses host oriented keying it is susceptible
	  to attacks described in [Bel96].

	* Authentication keys are kept in flat files and there is no concept
	  of indirect trust. An unscrupulous individual who is able to acquire
	  root privilege could mangle a key file-- thereby making 
	  authentication impossible-- or add the public keys of his 
	  unscrupulous friends to the public key ring.

	We encourage cryptographic analysis of this protocol implementation 
to expose any design flaws which, in the absence of the above known problems,
are serious security problems.

   Miscellany
   ----------

	A mailing list for problems, bug fixes, porting changes, patches,
complaints, compliments, announcements, and general discussion of ISAKMP and 
Oakley has been set up. It is isakmp-oakley@cisco.com. (majordomo@cisco.com
for admin requests).

	This distribution has been compiled under BSDI v2.1. We request that
any changes necessary for porting to other platforms be forwarded to the
mailing list.
