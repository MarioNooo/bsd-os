  The Cylink cryptographic library uses Colin Plumb's Big Number library.
It is necessary to compile the bignum library before the crypto library.
README files in the directory isakmp/cylink/bignum describe how to build and
test the bignum library on a variety of architectures.
  The README in isakmp/cylink/toolkit describes how to build and verify the
cryptographic toolkit.

  This toolkit operates on numbers which are LSB first. It has been modified 
(dnh.c) to flip Diffie-Hellman parameters and exponentials. Note that
DSS has not been modified to similarly flip it's parameters and it therefore
cannot interoperate with implementations which are MSB first (like BSAFE).
