  To compile cisco Systems' IKE daemon, go to the top-level directory
entitled "isakmp-jan98" and issue the "make" command. The daemon itself will
be in "isakmp-jan98/ikmpd/ikmpd". There is no "make install" rule. Debug 
options exist in the ikmpd makefile. By turning them off messages will be 
issued via syslog(3) and daemon will behave as such; turning them on will 
result in messages written to standard output and the daemon will behave as 
a regular application (no fork, keep controlling terminal, etc).
  It is recommended that the daemon be compiled without debugging and 
installed in a system directory such as /usr/local/bin. It can then be
started automatically upon system boot by adding it to the rc.local file.

  Random numbers are created with large amounts of entropy using truerand().
Obtaining 60 bits of randomness takes considerably more time than obtaining 12
bits of randomness. Depending on your local speed vs. security policy, you
may want to lessen (or even increase!) the amount of time it takes to obtain
random numbers. (Search for occurances of get_rand()).

  This package has been sucessfully compiled and run under BSDI v2.1. If
any porting is necessary for it to run under different versions or OS's
please forward the changes to isakmp-oakley@cisco.com.
