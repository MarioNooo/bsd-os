	This software package is maintained by both BSDI and the
	software contributor.  Please send any bug reports to both
	support@BSDI.COM and dab@borman.com.

	NOTE -- the sources live here, but the Makefile
	in /usr/lib/libtelnet really builds it.  It's part of the 
	regular distribution, but source is only domestic.
