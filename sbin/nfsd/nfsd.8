.Sh NAME
.Nm nfsd
.Nd remote
.Tn NFS
server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nfsd
.Op Fl prtu
.Op Fl n Ar num_servers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm nfsd
program runs on a server machine to service
.Tn NFS
requests from client machines.
At least one
.Nm nfsd
must be running for a machine to operate as a server.
The
.Fl t
and
.Fl u
options specify which protocols are to be served; both
.Tn TCP
and
.Tn UDP
are available.
The port numbers for each are taken from the
.Xr services 5
file, or default to 2049 (a non-privileged port)
as indicated in the
.Tn NFS
server specification; see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC1094 and
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" .
.Pp
The
.Nm nfsd
servers will ignore
.Tn IP
level options (e.g., source routing) on incoming requests.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n
Specifies how many servers to create.
The default is 4.
.It Fl p
Disables the default port number for service.
If there are no nfs entries in
.Xr services 5 ,\c
.Nm nfsd
will exit.
This can be used to ensure that only a privileged port will be served.
.It Fl r
Register the
.Tn NFS
service with
.Xr portmap 8
without creating any servers.
This option can be used along with the
.Fl u
or
.Fl t
options to re-register NFS if the portmap server is restarted.
.It Fl t
Serve
.Tn TCP NFS
clients.
.It Fl u
Serve
.Tn UDP NFS
clients.
.El
.Pp
For example, 
.Dq Li "nfsd -u -t -n 6"
serves
.Tn UDP
and
.Tn TCP
transports using six daemons.
.Pp
A server should run enough daemons to handle
the maximum level of concurrency from its clients,
typically four to six.
.Pp
The
.Nm nfsd
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

.Xr nfssvc 2 ,
.Xr mountd 8 ,
.Xr portmap 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm nfsd
utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.
