system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Sy Power fail and crash recovery.
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of any file systems on physical devices
will be performed,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
The system will not need to do a consistency check of any file system
which is on a NFS mount, or is a RAMDISK loaded along with the boot code
itself.
.Pp
.Sy Cold starts.
The PowerPC
can boot in a number of ways. First stage boot is handled by the
on board monitor, which is expected to set up the initial memory
controller states, and do a pci enumeration (if there is a pci bus).
After cold start initialisation, the on board monitor is expected to
load a copy of
.Pa boot
either from on board flash, or ide (disk on chip for example) via
the network over either tftp or nfs. The manner this is accomplished
is beyond the scope of this man page.
