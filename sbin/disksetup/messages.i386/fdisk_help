The FDISK screen is used to divide (partition) your hard disk for
use by one or more operating systems.  To install BSD/OS, you must have a
partition assigned to BSD/OS which has enough space to install its
filesystems on this disk.  Please refer to the installation guide for
help in determining how much disk space you will need to install BSD/OS.

At this point you may either go on to the next phase, alter a partition
displayed in the partition table, add a partition to the partition
table, delete a partition from the partition table, or exit this phase
without making any changes.

You may use one of the following commands:

A   Use 'A' to add a new partition.  For instance, you will need to have
    at least one partition for BSD/OS.  If you want to run DOS (or some
    other O/S) you will need a partition for it as well.

D   Use 'D' to delete the definition of a partition.  You will need to
    do this if your disk has old data on it that you no longer want.
    Deleting a partition will cause you to lose all the data contained
    in that partition.

*   Use '*' to assign the active boot partition.  The standard master
    boot record (MBR) will boot from the partition that is marked
    active.  If you use the BOOTANY bootstrap, the 'active' partition
    determines the default partition to boot from.

E   Use 'E' to change any of the parameters of a partition.  Generally
    you will only need to delete and add partitions.

N   Use 'N' to record the changes you have made and go on to the next
    phase of disksetup.  The changes will actually be applied when
    you finish setting up your disk.  At that time you will have one
    more chance to request that these changes (and all other changes
    during this session of disksetup) to not be made.

X   Discard all changes to the partition table and exit this phase of
    the program.  No changes to the partition table will be written to
    the disk.
