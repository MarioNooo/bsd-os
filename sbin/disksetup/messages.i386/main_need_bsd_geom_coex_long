The geometry of the drive that will be used by BSD/OS must now be determined.
If this disk was previously labeled, you should try using the [I]nternal
geometry.  A new disk typically should be [P]robed.  You may wish to enter
the BIOS geometry (if defined)  if you want the geometry to match that of
your other operating system.
