Disksetup will initialize your disk with 2 FDISK partitions.  You
must choose how much space to assign BSD/OS and how much for DOS.
BSD/OS requires between 60 and 300 MB of disk space depending on the
installation options chosen.  Typically you should try to have at least
120 MB for BSD/OS, 200 if you plan to use the X Window System.
