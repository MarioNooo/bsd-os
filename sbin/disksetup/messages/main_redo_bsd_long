You have aborted the BSD partition editor.  Any modifications made
to the BSD partition table have been forgotten.  You now have the
option to either exiting disksetup or restarting the editing of
the BSD partition table for this disk.  If you aborted the editor
because the table originally displayed was what you wanted, re-edit
the BSD label and use <N> to go on to the next phase.
