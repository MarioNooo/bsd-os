The geometry (number of heads, sectors per track and number of
cylinders) for the disk is needed.  Disksetup will do its best
to assist you in picking the geometry.  It is possible to find
the geometry from several places.  Below is a table of geometries
easily determined by disksetup.  (The BSD/OS geometry is only defined
if this disk has been previously labeled.)
