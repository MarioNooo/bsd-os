At this point you should select an FDISK partition you would like
to import.  When importing an FDISK partition, you are defining a
BSD partition which will reside within that FDISK partition.  This
does not affect the data within the FDISK partition.  You select
the FDISK partition by pressing the number of the partition you
wish to import.
