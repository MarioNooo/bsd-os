Are you sure you wish to save this table as the new
BSD Partition Table for this drive?
Doing so will cause you to lose all data stored in
any partition that you have modified or deleted.
If you have not backed up all data you wish to save,
then exit this program now with CTRL-C
and save your data appropriately.

Do you still wish to save this table?
