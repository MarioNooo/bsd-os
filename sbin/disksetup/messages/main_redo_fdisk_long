You have aborted the FDISK editor.  Any modifications made to
the FDISK table have been forgotten.  You now have the option
of either exiting disksetup or restarting the editing of the FDISK
table for this disk.  If you aborted the editor because the
label originally displayed was what you wanted, re-edit the
FDISK label and use <N> to go on to the next phase.
