The master boot record is located at the beginning of the disk with
the FDISK table.  The master boot record determines which FDISK
partition to boot from.  You may choose to either use the existing
master boot record or install a new master boot record.  The master
boot record provided with BSD/OS enable up to 4 operating systems to
be booted.  (Some operating systems have been noted to not work with
this master boot record.)
