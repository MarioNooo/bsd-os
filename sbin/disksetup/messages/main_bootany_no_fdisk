It appears that somehow bootany expects to be installed but there is
no FDISK table to install.  This probably indicates a logic error
someplace in disksetup.  Please inform support@bsdi.com of this and
how you got to this point.  Disksetup will not be modifying the
boot record to contain the bootany data.  When asked about installing
the Master Boot Record, you are advised to answer no.
