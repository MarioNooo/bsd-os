At this point you should select the partition you wish to mark as active
by pressing the number which corresponds to that partition.

The standard master boot record (MBR) will boot from which ever
partition is marked active.  If you use the BOOTANY bootstrap, the
active partition determines the default partition to boot from.

You may press <ESC> if you do not wish to set the active partition.
