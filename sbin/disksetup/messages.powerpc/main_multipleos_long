BSD/OS may be installed as

    * The only operating system on the disk.
      Some disk controllers may require an FDISK table even if BSD/OS is
      to be the only operating system on the disk.

    * Sharing the disk with other operating systems, such as DOS.
      This requires an FDISK table.
