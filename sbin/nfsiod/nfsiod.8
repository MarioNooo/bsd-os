.Sh NAME
.Nm nfsiod
.Nd local
.Tn NFS
asynchronous I/O server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nfsiod
.Op Fl n Ar num_servers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Nfsiod
runs on an
.Tn NFS
client machine to service asynchronous I/O requests to one or more
.Tn NFS
servers.
The use of
.Nm nfsiods
can greatly improve performance, but are not required for correct
operation.
.Pp
Unless otherwise specified, a single server is started.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n
Specify how many servers are to be started.
.El
.Pp
The optimal number of
.Nm
servers to run depends on many factors, including network speed and
latency, NFS server latency, client and server processor speed.
Experimentation is the best way to determine the optimum number of
servers to run.
.Pp
The minimum number of
.Nm
servers to run is probably four.  
In a simple NFS environment with fast NFS servers, twelve
.Nm
servers will greatly increase performance.  
The upper bound on a useful number of servers is probably several
dozen unless very high performance hardware is in use.
.Pp
It is possible to run
.Nm
multiple times to increase the number of servers running.  It is also
possible to kill running
.Nm
processes to reduce the number of servers without causing
complications.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.
