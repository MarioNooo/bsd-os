The LaserJet IIISi does not support PostScript level 2, only level 1
(really, it is called 3SiMX).
The Windows (you are under Windows, right?) HP driver for 3Si/3Si MX
PostScript should produce only PS level 1.
<p>
Beware: latest version of Adobe Windows PS driver produces *ONLY* PS
level 2.
So if you have (or receive) level 2 files, read them using GhostScript
and print a screen dump :-) or as a bitmap. 
<p>
You can also convert them into PDF (using either Adobe distiller or
GhostScript's ps2pdf) then use <it/acroread/ to print the result.
<it/Acroread/ can
produce either level 1 or level 2 PostScript. THE definite solution!
<p>
This trouble has nothing to do with the way they are connected,
it is only a driver problem.
I believe that HP had once a PS level2 update, but the price was so high
that buying a new printer was a better solution!
