Comments:

This directory contains only the subset of glibc needed to build
the dynamic linker for LAP.

Modifications to this version made by BSDI:

Unfortunately the glibc dynamic linker isn't prepared to handle more than
one versioned library with the same name and different symbols in the same
scope.  I changed do_lookup_versioned() so that it doesn't gag on libraries
that don't contain the expected weak definition of a versioned symbol, as
long as some preceding library has provided a weak definition.  This is not
a general solution, but it works for LAP, since we will search the real GNU
C library before we search the dummy C library, and the real GNU C library
will always contain the symbol that we need.
