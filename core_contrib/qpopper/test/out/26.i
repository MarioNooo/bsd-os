<BLOCKQUOTE TYPE=CITE>At recent Feasts, there have been a few non-Baha'is

I think

Glen,How is this idea rectified with the following quote:

<P>&nbsp;Let him remember the example set by Abdu'l-Baha, and His constant
admonition to shower such kindness upon the seeker, and exemplify to such
a degree the spirit of the teachings he hopes to instill into him, that
the recipient will be spontaneously impelled to identify himself with the
Cause embodying such teachings.&nbsp; Let him refrain, at the outset, from
insisting on such laws and observances as might impose too severe a strain
on the seeker's newly awakened faith, and endeavor to nurse him, patiently,
tactfully, and yet determinedly, into full maturity, and <B>aid him to
proclaim his unqualified acceptance of whatever has been ordained by Baha'u'llah.&nbsp;
Let him, as soon as that stage has been attained, introduce him to the
body of his fellow-believers</B>, and seek, through constant fellowship
and active participation in the local activities of his community, to enable
him to contribute his share to the enrichment of its life, the furtherance
of its tasks, the consolidations of its interests, and the coordination
of its activities with those of its sister communities.&nbsp; Let him not
be content until he has infused into his spiritual child so deep a longing
as to impel him to arise independently, in his turn, and devote his energies
to the quickening of other souls, and the upholding of the laws and principles
laid down by his newly adopted Faith.

<P>Just curious about your take on this?
