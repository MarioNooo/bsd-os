"...Heedless souls are always seeking faults in others.
What can the hypocrite know of others' faults when he is
blind to his own? Nothing is more fruitful for man than
the knowledge of his own shortcomings... 'I wonder at the
man who does not find his own imperfections.'"

“...souls will arise and holy beings appear who, as stars, would adorn the firmament of 
divine guidance; illumine the dayspring of loving-kindness and bounty; manifest the 
signs of the unity of God; shine with light of sanctity and purity; receive their full 
measure of divine inspiration; raise high the sacred torch of faith; stand firm as the rock 
and immoveable as the mountain; and grow to become luminaries in the heavens of His 
Revelation, mighty channels of His grace, means for the bestowal of God's bountiful care, 
heralds calling forth the name of the One true God, and establishers of the world's 
supreme foundation...                                                                     - Abdu’l-Baha
