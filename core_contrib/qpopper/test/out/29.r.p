A VOICE GREETING FROM THE BAHA'I PRAYERS AS READ BY 
STEPHANIE HECK.  

I AM A MEMBER OF THE BAHA'I FAITH   

"In just over 100 years, the Baha'i Faith [Founded by Baha'u'llah (1817 -  
1892) has grown from an obscure movement in the Middle East to the  
second-most widespread of the independent world religions. Embracing  
people from more than 2,100 ethnic, racial and tribal groups, it is quite likely the most diverse organized body of people on the planet. Its unity challenges  
prevailing theories about human nature and the prospects for our common  
future.    
The main theme of Baha'u'llah's message is unity. He taught that there is only  
one God, that all the world's religions represent one changeless and eternal  
Faith of God, and that all humanity is one race, destined to live in peace and  
harmony." --- Excerpted from The Baha'is, a publication of the Baha'i  
International Community.
