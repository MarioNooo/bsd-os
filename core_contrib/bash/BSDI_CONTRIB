Modifications to this version made by BSDI:

Be sure and run:

# CC=shlicc ./configure

Instead of just ./configure or else bash will try to use ldopen,
ldclose, and ldsym which shlicc doesn't support in 4.0.  We should
eventually change the configure.in file to make this automatic for
BSDI 4.0.

Addition of the file "makefile", to do man page formatting and
provide the standard BSDI targets.
