This source for nettest and nettestd are provided on an "as is" basis.
Cray Research does not provide any support for this code (unless you
are a customer who has purchased the UNICOS operating system).

We will gladly take bug reports for nettest/nettestd.  Suggested
fixes are prefered to just bug reports.  Changes to allow
nettest/nettestd to run on other architectures are also welcomed.
We will try to incorporate bugfixes and update the publicly available
code, but we can make no guarantees.

Notes:

1) The -b option to nettestd has not been tested...

2) The ISO code should work on a 4.4BSD system, but the
   gethostinfo() routine is specific to UNICOS...
