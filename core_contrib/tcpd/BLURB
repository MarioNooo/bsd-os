This patch upgrades the tcp wrappers 7.2 source code to version 7.3.
The patch improves portability. It does not add any new features. If
versions 7.0 .. 7.2 work for you do not bother applying this patch.

The most significant changes with respect to the previous release:

    - Portability: support or workarounds for Unixware 1.x and 2.x;
    CRAY Unicos 8.x; MachTen; Interactive UNIX; SCO OpenServer 5;
    FreeBSD 2.0. Specific hints and tips for Solaris 2.x and AIX.

    - Bugfix: there was an amusing fencepost error when handling very
    long access control rules.

    - Other: more tests and diagnostics in the tcpdmatch/tcpdchk
    configuration checking programs.

A complete change log is given in the CHANGES document.  As always,
problem reports and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
