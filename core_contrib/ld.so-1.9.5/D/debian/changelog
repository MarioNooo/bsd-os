ld.so (1.9.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

ld.so (1.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed a bug in ld.so introduced in the previous version
    which broke preloads.
  * Turned a.out support back on by default, at least for the
    time being.  There are no promises to keep it.

 -- David Engel <david@sw.ods.com>  Sat, 26 Jul 1997 14:21:23 -0500

 -- David Engel <david@sw.ods.com>  Mon, 21 Jul 1997 15:55:13 -0500

ld.so (1.9.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a warning in the description not to downgrade to 
    version 1.8.x or earlier.

    (Bug#10025).

 -- David Engel <david@sw.ods.com>  Tue, 27 May 1997 10:27:48 -0500

ld.so (1.9.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a libdl1-altdev package which can coexist with the
    libc6-dev package.

 -- David Engel <david@sw.ods.com>  Fri, 2 May 1997 21:45:40 -0500

ld.so (1.9.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed /usr/local/lib from the default /etc/ld.so.conf
    for Debian (Bug#8181).
  * Changed ldconfig to be 64-bit clean (H.J. Lu).

 -- David Engel <david@sw.ods.com>  Tue, 22 Apr 1997 19:56:26 -0500

ld.so (1.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed ldconfig to try to determine which libc a
    library is for even if it doesn't have an soname.
  * Fixed a bug in ldconfig where an older library using
    the glibc naming convention would be used instead of
    a newer library.
  * Changed to ld-linux.so and libdl.so to not require the 
    libc5 headers in order to compile.
  * Changed ldconfig and ldd to be compilable with either
    libc5 or libc6.

 -- David Engel <david@sw.ods.com>  Tue, 18 Mar 1997 20:46:50 -0600

ld.so (1.9.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed to not build the old, a.out dynamic loader by
    default.
  * Changed instldso.sh to require the --force option to
    make sure users read the README file.
  * Changed instldso.sh to not install the libdl.so
    development files unless the --devfiles option is used.
  * Changed instldso.sh to not strip binaries and libraries
    if the --no-strip option is used.
  * Changed the Debian packaging to put the development files 
    which conflict with glibc in a new libdl1-dev package.
  * Changed ldd to use the glibc dynamic linker, if it is
    available, when run on a shared library.
  * Changed ld-linux.so to print the load addresses of
    libraries, ala glibc, when run by ldd.
  * Changed ld-linux.so to allow the libraries listed in 
    LD_PRELOAD to be separated by white space in addition to 
    colons.
  * Changed ld-linux.so to load the libraries listed in 
    LD_PRELOAD for setu/gid programs as long as they can be 
    loaded securely.
  * Changed ldconfig to update the symlinks for the dynamic
    linkers.
  * Changed ldconfig to try to determine if an ELF library is
    intended for libc5 or libc6 and save the infomation in the
    cache.  The mechanism used is rather simplistic and may
    need to be enhanced.
  * Changed ldconfig to print the type of ELF library when
    printing the cache.
  * Changed ld-linux.so to only load ELF shared libraries for
    use with libc5 or an unknown libc.

ld.so (1.8.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the shlibs file so other packages would depend on ldso
    instead of libdl1.

 -- David Engel <david@sw.ods.com>  Mon, 3 Mar 1997 11:40:34 -0600

ld.so (1.8.10-1) stable unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug in ldconfig where a symlink could be used
    instead of a regular file.

  * Fixed a Debian packaging problem for the sparc 
    architecture.

 -- David Engel <david@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Feb 1997 20:49:23 -0600

ld.so (1.8.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed ldconfig to only cache the symlinks it creates.
    This make the behavior of the dynamic linkers consistent
     with how they would behave if a cache was not used.

  * Changed ldconfig to cache the symlinks that it finds but
    use the name of the symlink as the soname instead of the 
    actual soname.

 -- David Engel <david@debian.org>  Sun, 9 Feb 1997 00:32:25 -0600

ld.so (1.8.8-1) stable unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor documentation updates to reflect recent changes.

  * Changed ld.so and ld-linux.so to perform more complete
    validation on ld.so.cache before using it.

  * Changed ldconfig to accept libraries with inconsistent
    sonames since glibc is going to use them.  A warning is
    still printed in debug mode.

  * Changed the install script to not strip _dl_debug_state
    from ld-linux.so since gdb needs it.

  * More sparc fixes (Derrick Brashear).

  * Changed ldconfig to not issue a warning when a linker
    script disguised as a shared library is found.

  * Fixed a bug in ld-linux.so where some registers were 
    not preserved on the first call to a function causing 
    problems for non-C-like languages (Tim Renouf).

  * Fixed a bug in ld-linux.so where global variables were 
    not always mapped correctly across dynamically loaded 
    libraries (Mikihiko Nakao).

  * Converted to new Debian source packaging format (Shaya
    Potter).
