#
#	This file contains a list of RADIUS clients which are allowed
#	to make RADIUS authentication and RADIUS accounting requests
#	of this server and their encryption keys or shared secrets.
#
#	The first field may be an IP address or a valid DNS hostname.
#	The IP address or hostname optionally may be followed by a
#	colon and a TCP/UDP port number.  This value overrides the -pp
#	and -qq options of the Merit AAA server.  The accounting port
#	number is assumed to be one greater than the authentication port.
#
#	The second field (separated by blanks or tabs) is the encryption
#	key or shared secret.  Secrets may be up to 254 characters in length.
#
#	The third field is optional and is the type field.  This field
#	may be used to specify the vendor and/or the type of the RADIUS
#	client or requesting RADIUS server.  If omitted, the type and
#	vendor name are unspecified.  The server honors vendor specific
#	attributes for a given vendor to be sent to a client from that
#	vendor (i.e., involving mapping and pruning) only if that vendor's
#	name appears on the associated NAS entry.  Valid types are "NAS",
#	"PROXY", "RAD_RFC", "ACCT_RFC", "DEBUG" and "APPEND", and for US
#	Robotics products, "DAS", "FRGW" and "NEIGHBOR".  Different types
#	may be logically combined ("ANDed") using the plus sign ("+")
#	character.  See the examples at the end of this file.
#
#	The fourth field is optional and specifies the RADIUS version
#	spoken over the connection between this server and the client
#	on this line.  If this is omitted, it defaults to version one.
#	Currently, the only valid versions are "V1" and "V2" keywords.
#	Version one is described in the IETF RADIUS standard document,
#	and version two is described in draft-calhoun-enh-radius-00.txt
#	written by Pat Calhoun of US Robotics.
#
#	The fifth, and last, field is optional and specifies a prefix
#	which may be used to select an authfile and/or users file, which
#	is different than the "standard" authfile or users file, to be
#	used for requests from the associated client.  This prefix is
#	pre-pended to the configuration file name (normally, "users"
#	and "authfile").
#
#	The "<name1>/<name2>" style entries may be used to specify the pair
#	of servers for which an entry applies.  This allows the same clients
#	file to be used by and distributed to different Merit AAA servers.
#	Using this style for the first field precludes the use of the
#	optional [:<tcp-udp-port>] modifier.
