  This (the Directory node) gives a menu of major topics.  Typing "d"
  returns here, "q" exits, "?" lists all INFO commands, "h" gives a primer
  for first-timers, "mEmacs<Return>" visits the Emacs topic, etc.  In Emacs,
  you can click mouse button 2 on a menu item or cross reference to select it.
