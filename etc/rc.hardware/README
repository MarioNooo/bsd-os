Files in /etc/rc.hardware directory will be run if they are of the
general form numeric.id*.numeric. The leading numeric field is
used to force execution in a prescribed order. The trailing numeric
field always represents the particular unit number which is being
initialized. The id field is used as an identifier for what particular
piece of hardware is being initialized. An example of this is
"5.xxx.0". This runs the xxx setup program on unit 0. The leading
5 means that it doesn't need to be run early or late compared to
the other programs in /etc/rc.hardware.

It is permissible to have more than 2 dots. For example "5.zzz.2.4.0".
This means run the zzz setup program on unit 0. The digits 2 and 4
have a meaning which is specific to the zzz setup script.
