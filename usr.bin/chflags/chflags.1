.Dt CHFLAGS 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm chflags
.Nd change file flags
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm chflags
.Oo
.Fl R
.Op Fl H | Fl L | Fl P
.Oc
.Ar flags
.Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm chflags
utility modifies the file flags of the listed files
as specified by the
.Ar flags
operand.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl H
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed.
(Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.)
.It Fl L
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl R
Change the file flags for the file hierarchies rooted
in the files instead of just the files themselves.
.El
.Pp
Flags are a comma separated list of keywords.
The following keywords are currently defined:
.Bd -literal -offset indent compact
.\"arch	nothing yet.
opaque	set the opaque flag (owner or super-user only)
nodump	set the nodump flag (owner or super-user only)
notime	set the notime flag (super-user only)
sappnd	set the system append-only flag (super-user only)
schg	set the system immutable flag (super-user only)
uappnd	set the user append-only flag (owner or super-user only)
uchg	set the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)
.Ed
.Pp
Putting the letters
.Dq no
before an option causes the flag to be turned off.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent compact
nouchg	the immutable bit should be cleared
.Ed
.Pp
The two
.Dq append
flags prevent truncation of the file.
For instance, log files might be set to append-only.
The two
.Dq immutable
.Pq Dq chg
flags prevent any changes to the file at all,
except for changes to the flags.
If either or both of
.Li sappnd
or
.Li schg
is set, however, not even the super-user can change the flags
unless the system is in
.Dq insecure
mode (typically, single user).
The user flags can be set by the owner or the super-user;
the system flags can only be set by the super-user.
.Pp
The only flags on by default are
.Li dump and time.
.Pp
Symbolic links do not have flags, so unless the
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
option is set,
.Nm chflags
on a symbolic link always succeeds and has no effect.
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L
and
.Fl P
options are ignored unless the
.Fl R
option is specified.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command's actions are determined by the last one specified.
.Pp
The
.Nm chflags
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh NOTES
The
.Li notime
flag is an experimental feature.  It only applies to character,
block, fifo and socket special files.  It prevents updating
the access, modify, and inode-change time stamps of any inode (which would
cause an otherwise idle disk to spin up on a notebook).  A typical
notime request might be:
.sp
.sp
.Li Ta "# cd /dev ; chflags notime console null pcaux0 pty* tty*"
