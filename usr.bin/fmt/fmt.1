.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm fmt
.Op Fl d
.Oo
.Ar goal
.Op Ar maximum
.Oc
.Op name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Fmt
is a simple text formatter which reads the concatenation of input
files (or standard input if none are given) and produces on standard
output a version of its input with lines as close to the
.Ar goal
length
as possible without exceeding the maximum.  The
.Ar goal
length defaults
to 65 and the maximum to 75.  The spacing at the beginning of the
input lines is preserved in the output, as are blank lines and
interword spacing.
.Pp
.Nm Fmt
is meant to format mail messages prior to sending, but may also be useful
for other simple tasks.
For instance,
within visual mode of the
.Xr ex 1
editor (e.g.
.Xr vi 1 )
the command
.Pp
.Dl \&!}fmt
.Pp
will reformat a paragraph,
evening the lines.
.Pp
.Nm Fmt
supports one option:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl d
Don't break text at lines that begin with a dot
.Pq Sq \&. .
.Nm Fmt
normally preserves line breaks before and after
input lines that begin with a dot so that
.Xr nroff 1
commands can be passed through unchanged.
.El
.Pp
.Nm Fmt
looks for certain mail header lines in the input
and preserves line breaks before and after them.
The rules are fairly restrictive.
.Nm Fmt
will preserve a line break before and after
a traditional Unix mail header line that begins with
.Sq Li From\ 
and contains a sender and a date.
It is not necessary for this line to be preceded by a blank line in the input.
If a line beginning with
.Sq Li To ,
.Sq Li Subject
or
.Sq Li Cc
is found within 2 input lines after a
.Sq Li From\ 
line,
.Nm fmt
preserves line breaks before and after such lines.
.Pp
.Nm Fmt
recognizes certain sentence-ending punctuation marks
at the ends of input lines,
and ensures that they will be padded by two spaces
in running output text instead of the usual one space.
The recognized marks are
.Sq Li \&. ,
.Sq Li \&: ,
.Sq Li \&!
and
.Sq Li \&? .
.Pp
.Nm Fmt
takes into account any overstriking or underlining
with backspaces when calculating output line length.
.Pp
If consecutive input lines have a common indentation,
.Nm fmt
preserves that indentation in the output.
If the indentation increases, or if it decreases by more than
8 character positions,
.Nm fmt
breaks output lines.
This allows
.Nm fmt
to fill most indented paragraphs correctly,
and to fill consecutive indented input lines correctly as well.

.Xr nroff 1 ,
.Xr mail 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm fmt
command appeared in
.Bx 3 .

.\" Kurt Shoens
.\" .br
.\" Liz Allen (added goal length concept)
.Sh BUGS
The program was designed to be simple and fast \- for more complex
operations, the standard text processors are likely to be more appropriate.
.Pp
File names that look like numbers can be mistaken for the
.Ar goal
or
.Ar maximum
parameters.
.Pp
The mail header rules are arcane.
