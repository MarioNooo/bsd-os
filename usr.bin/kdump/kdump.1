.Sh NAME
.Nm kdump
.Nd display kernel trace data
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kdump
.Op Fl dnlRT
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl m Ar maxdata
.Op Fl t Op +acinsw
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Kdump
displays the kernel trace files produced with
.Xr ktrace 1
in human readable format.
By default, the file
.Pa ktrace.out
in the current directory is displayed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl d
Display all numbers in decimal.
.It Fl f Ar file 
Display the specified file instead of
.Pa ktrace.out .
.It Fl l
Loop reading the trace file, once the end-of-file is reached, waiting for
more data.
.It Fl m Ar maxdata 
Display at most
.Ar maxdata
bytes when decoding
.Tn I/O .
.It Fl n
Suppress ad hoc translations.
Normally
.Nm kdump
tries to decode many system calls into a more human readable format.
For example,
.Xr ioctl 2
values are replaced with the macro name and
.Va errno
values are replaced with the
.Xr strerror 3
string.
Suppressing this feature yields a more consistent output format and is
easily amenable to further processing.
.It Fl R
Display relative timestamps (time since previous entry).
.It Fl r
Display base relative timestamps (time since first entry).
.It Fl T
Display absolute timestamps for each entry (seconds since epoch).
.It Fl t Ar acinsw
Selects which types of trace records to display.  
The default is to display all trace records in the trace file.
See the
.Fl t
option of
.Xr ktrace 1
for a detailed listing of the available options.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm kdump
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ktrace 1 ,
.Xr ktrace 2
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm kdump
command appears in
.Bx 4.4 .
