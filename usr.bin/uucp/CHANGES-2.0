BSDI CHANGES-2.0,v 2.2 1996/06/11 19:26:09 vixie Exp

16. added uuq, uupoll, and muucp to new contrib/ directory.

15. /etc/uucp/daily will now call uusnap by its full path name.

14. uuto was echoing rather than executing its derived uucp command.

13. close_dev() now sets clocal in case the chat script had P_CLOCAL_OFF.

12. Special release notes for BSD/OS 2.0:
	a. 2.0's getty uses 8N1, 1.1's used 7E1.  your neighbors may have to
	   set "no parity" when they call you after you upgrade to BSD/OS 2.0.
	b. "make install" doesn't overwrite files in /etc/uucp, so if you are
	   installing from source you will need to move admin/weekly.sh to
	   /etc/uucp/weekly, by hand.
	c. more changes are coming.

11. there is now a "HALFWAY" status, meaning some files transferred, then 
    the connection failed.

10. exponential backoff now is, semi.

9. status files will now be world readable, so uusnap -av can run.

8. weekly has been straightened out wrt nonexisting directories or files.
