.Sh NAME
.Nm nm
.Nd display the name list of an executable binary file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nm
.Op Fl agnopruw
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The symbol table (name list) of each executable binary
or relocatable object
.Ar file
is displayed.
If a library (archive) is given,
.Nm 
displays a list for each
object archive member.
If no
.Ar file
is given,
.Nm
searches for the file
.Pa a.out
and if it is present, displays the symbol
table for
.Pa a.out .
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl a
Display symbol table entries inserted for use by debuggers.
.It Fl g
Restrict display to external (global) symbols.
.It Fl n
Present results in numerical order.
.It Fl o
Display the full path or library name of the object on every line.
.It Fl p
Do not sort at all.
.It Fl r
Reverse the order of the sort.
.It Fl u
Display undefined symbols only.
.It Fl w
Warn about non-object archive members.
Normally, nm will silently ignore all archive members which are not
object files.
.El
.Pp
Each symbol name is preceded by its value (a blank field if the symbol
is undefined) and one of the following letters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Fl
debugger symbol table entries (see the
.Fl a
option).
.It Li A
absolute
.It Li B
bss segment symbol
.It Li C
common symbol
.It Li D
data segment symbol
.It Li f
file name
.It Li R
read-only data segment symbol
.It Li T
text segment symbol
.It Li U
undefined
.El
.Pp
If the symbol is local (non-external) the type letter is in lower case.
The output is sorted alphabetically by default.

.Sh HISTORY
An
.Nm nm
command appeared in
.At v6 .
.Sh BUGS
The types and values that
.Nm nm
displays for file formats other than the old
.Xr a.out 5
format are only approximations.
The
.Xr objdump 1
program displays a somewhat more detailed
name list, as well as other information about binary files.
.Pp
The
.Nm nm
program doesn't handle COFF binary files.
