Memtest86
=============

This is an offline (standalone) memory tester. It is run by writing the
test binary to a floppy and then booting the floppy.

To write/run the memory test:
	1. Format a 1.4M floppy
	2. # dd if=memtest.image of=/dev/rfd0 bs=512
	3. Boot from the resulting floppy

On some systems it may be neccesary to do a hard reset before botting 
to allow the test to run without errors. 

This test has particular value on systems without parity RAM or parity
detection logic.
