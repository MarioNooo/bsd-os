<H1><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC2">Introduction</A></H1>

<P>
Kerberos V5 is an authentication system developed at MIT.
Kerberos is named for the three-headed watchdog from Greek mythology,
who guarded the entrance to the underworld.


<P>
Under Kerberos, a client (generally either a user or a service) sends a
request for a ticket to the <I>Key Distribution Center</I> (KDC).  The KDC
creates a <EM>ticket-granting ticket</EM> (TGT) for the client, encrypts it
using the client's password as the key, and sends the encrypted TGT back
to the client.  The client then attempts to decrypt the TGT, using its
password.  If the client successfully decrypts the TGT (<I>i.e.</I>, if the
client gave the correct password), it keeps the decrypted TGT, which
indicates proof of the client's identity.


<P>
The TGT, which expires at a specified time, permits the client to obtain
additional tickets, which give permission for specific services.  The
requesting and granting of these additional tickets is user-transparent.


<P>
Since Kerberos negotiates authenticated, and optionally encrypted,
communications between two points anywhere on the internet, it provides
a layer of security that is not dependent on which side of a firewall
either client is on.  Since studies have shown that half of the computer
security breaches in industry happen from <I>inside</I> firewalls,
MIT's Kerberos V5 plays a vital role in maintaining your
nework security.


<P>
The Kerberos V5 package is designed to be easy to use.  Most of the
commands are nearly identical to UNIX network programs you are already
used to.  Kerberos V5 is a <EM>single-sign-on</EM> system, which means
that you have to type your password only once per session, and Kerberos
does the authenticating and encrypting transparently.




<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC3">What is a Ticket?</A></H2>

<P>
Your Kerberos <EM>credentials</EM>, or "<EM>tickets</EM>", are a set of
electronic information that can be used to verify your identity.  Your
Kerberos tickets may be stored in a file, or they may exist only in
memory.


<P>
The first ticket you obtain is a <EM>ticket-granting ticket</EM>, which
permits you to obtain additional tickets.  These additional tickets give
you permission for specific services.  The requesting and granting of
these additional tickets happens transparently.


<P>
A good analogy for the ticket-granting ticket is a three-day ski pass
that is good at four different resorts.  You show the pass at whichever
resort you decide to go to (until it expires), and you receive a lift
ticket for that resort.  Once you have the lift ticket, you can ski all
you want at that resort.  If you go to another resort the next day, you
once again show your pass, and you get an additional lift ticket for the
new resort.  The difference is that the Kerberos V5 programs notice
that you have the weekend ski pass, and get the lift ticket for you, so
you don't have to perform the transactions yourself.




<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC4">What is a Kerberos Principal?</A></H2>

<P>
A Kerberos <EM>principal</EM> is a unique identity to which Kerberos can
assign tickets.  By convention, a principal is divided into three parts:
the <EM>primary</EM>, the <EM>instance</EM>, and the <EM>realm</EM>.  The format
of a typical Kerberos V5 principal is <CODE>primary/instance@REALM</CODE>.



<UL>
<LI>The <EM>primary</EM> is the first part of the principal.  In the case

of a user, it's the same as your username.  For a host, the primary is
the word <CODE>host</CODE>.

<LI>The <EM>instance</EM> is an optional string that qualifies the

primary.  The instance is separated from the primary by a slash
(<CODE>/</CODE>).  In the case of a user, the instance is usually null, but a
user might also have an additional principal, with an instance called
<SAMP>`admin'</SAMP>, which he/she uses to administrate a database.  The
principal <CODE>jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU</CODE> is completely
separate from the principal
<CODE>jennifer/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU</CODE>, with a separate
password, and separate permissions.  In the case of a host, the instance
is the fully qualified hostname, e.g.,
<CODE>daffodil.mit.edu</CODE>.

<LI>The <EM>realm</EM> is your Kerberos realm.  In most cases, your

Kerberos realm is your domain name, in upper-case letters.  For example,
the machine <CODE>daffodil.mit.edu</CODE> would be in
the realm <CODE>ATHENA.MIT.EDU</CODE>.
</UL>



<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC5">Kerberos V5 Tutorial</A></H1>

<P>
This tutorial is intended to familiarize you with the Kerberos V5
client programs.  We will represent your prompt as "<CODE>shell%</CODE>".
So an instruction to type the "<KBD>ls</KBD>" command would be represented as
follows:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> ls
</PRE>

<P>
In these examples, we will use sample usernames, such as
<CODE>jennifer</CODE> and <CODE>david</CODE>, sample
hostnames, such as <CODE>daffodil</CODE> and
<CODE>trillium</CODE>, and sample domain names, such as
<CODE>mit.edu</CODE> and <CODE>fubar.org</CODE>.  When you
see one of these, substitute your username, hostname, or domain name
accordingly.




<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC6">Setting Up to Use Kerberos V5</A></H2>

<P>
Your system administrator will have installed the Kerberos V5
programs in whichever directory makes the most sense for your system.
We will use <CODE>/usr/local</CODE> throughout this guide to refer to the
top-level directory Kerberos V5 directory.  We will therefor use
<CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE> to denote the location of the Kerberos V5 user
programs.  In your installation, the directory name may be different,
but whatever the directory name is, you should make sure it is included
in your path.  You will probably want to put it <I>ahead of</I> the
directories <CODE>/bin</CODE> and <CODE>/usr/bin</CODE> so you will get the
Kerberos V5 network programs, rather than the standard UNIX
versions, when you type their command names.




<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC7">Ticket Management</A></H2>

<P>
On many systems, Kerberos is built into the login program, and you get
tickets automatically when you log in.  Other programs, such as
<CODE>rsh</CODE>, <CODE>rcp</CODE>, <CODE>telnet</CODE>, and <CODE>rlogin</CODE>, can forward
copies of your tickets to the remote host.  Most of these programs also
automatically destroy your tickets when they exit.  However,
MIT recommends that you explicitly destroy your Kerberos
tickets when you are through with them, just to be sure.  One way to
help ensure that this happens is to add the <CODE>kdestroy</CODE> command to
your <CODE>.logout</CODE> file.  Additionally, if you are going to be away
from your machine and are concerned about an intruder using your
permissions, it is safest to either destroy all copies of your tickets,
or use a screensaver that locks the screen.




<H3><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC8">Obtaining Tickets with kinit</A></H3>

<P>
If your site is using the Kerberos V5 login program, you will get
Kerberos tickets automatically when you log in.  If your site uses a
different login program, you may need to explicitly obtain your Kerberos
tickets, using the <CODE>kinit</CODE> program.  Similarly, if your Kerberos
tickets expire, use the <CODE>kinit</CODE> program to obtain new ones.


<P>
To use the <CODE>kinit</CODE> program, simply type <KBD>kinit</KBD> and then type
your password at the prompt.  For example, Jennifer (whose username is
<CODE>jennifer</CODE>) works for Bleep, Inc. (a fictitious company
with the domain name <CODE>mit.edu</CODE> and the Kerberos realm
<CODE>ATHENA.MIT.EDU</CODE>).  She would type:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> kinit
<B>Password for jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:</B> <I>&#60;-- [Type jennifer's password here.]</I>
<B>shell%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
If you type your password incorrectly, kinit will give you the following
error message:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> kinit
<B>Password for jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:</B> <I>&#60;-- [Type the wrong password here.]</I>
<B>kinit: Password incorrect</B>
<B>shell%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
and you won't get Kerberos tickets.


<P>
Notice that <CODE>kinit</CODE> assumes you want tickets for your own
username in your default realm.  
Suppose Jennifer's friend David is visiting, and he wants to borrow a
window to check his mail.  David needs to get tickets for himself in his
own realm, FUBAR.ORG.<A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="user-guide_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>  He would type:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> kinit david@FUBAR.ORG
<B>Password for david@FUBAR.ORG:</B> <I>&#60;-- [Type david's password here.]</I>
<B>shell%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
David would then have tickets which he could use to log onto
his own machine.  Note that he typed his password locally on Jennifer's
machine, but it never went over the network.  Kerberos on the local host
performed the authentication to the KDC in the other realm.


<P>
If you want to be able to forward your tickets to another host, you need
to request <EM>forwardable</EM> tickets.  You do this by specifying the
<KBD>-f</KBD> option:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> kinit -f
<B>Password for jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:</B> <I>&#60;-- [Type your password here.]</I>
<B>shell%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
Note that <CODE>kinit</CODE> does not tell you that it obtained forwardable
tickets; you can verify this using the <CODE>klist</CODE> command
(see section <A HREF="user-guide.html#SEC9">Viewing Your Tickets with klist</A>).


<P>
Normally, your tickets are good for your system's default ticket
lifetime, which is ten hours on many systems.  You can specify a
different ticket lifetime with the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option.  Add the letter
<SAMP>`s'</SAMP> to the value for seconds, <SAMP>`m'</SAMP> for minutes, <SAMP>`h'</SAMP> for
hours, or <SAMP>`d'</SAMP> for days.
For example, to obtain forwardable tickets for
<CODE>david@FUBAR.ORG</CODE> that would be good for
three hours, you would type:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> kinit -f -l 3h david@FUBAR.ORG
<B>Password for david@FUBAR.ORG:</B> <I>&#60;-- [Type david's password here.]</I>
<B>shell%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
You cannot mix units; specifying a lifetime of <SAMP>`3h30m'</SAMP> would result
in an error.  Note also that most systems specify a maximum ticket
lifetime.  If you request a longer ticket lifetime, it will be
automatically truncated to the maximum lifetime.




<H3><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC9">Viewing Your Tickets with klist</A></H3>

<P>
The <CODE>klist</CODE> command shows your tickets.  When you first obtain
tickets, you will have only the ticket-granting ticket.  (See section <A HREF="user-guide.html#SEC3">What is a Ticket?</A>.)  The listing would look like this:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> klist
Ticket cache: /tmp/krb5cc_ttypa
Default principal: jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
06/07/96 19:49:21  06/08/96 05:49:19  krbtgt/ATHENA.MIT.EDU@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
<B>shell%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
The ticket cache is the location of your ticket file.  In the above
example, this file is named <CODE>/tmp/krb5cc_ttypa</CODE>.  The default
principal is your kerberos <EM>principal</EM>.  (see section <A HREF="user-guide.html#SEC4">What is a Kerberos Principal?</A>)


<P>
The "valid starting" and "expires" fields describe the period of
time during which the ticket is valid.  The <EM>service principal</EM>
describes each ticket.  The ticket-granting ticket has the primary
<CODE>krbtgt</CODE>, and the instance is the realm name.


<P>
Now, if jennifer connected to the machine
<CODE>daffodil.mit.edu</CODE>, and then typed
<KBD>klist</KBD> again, she would have gotten the following result:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> klist
Ticket cache: /tmp/krb5cc_ttypa
Default principal: jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
06/07/96 19:49:21  06/08/96 05:49:19  krbtgt/ATHENA.MIT.EDU@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
06/07/96 20:22:30  06/08/96 05:49:19  host/daffodil.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
<B>shell%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
Here's what happened:  when jennifer used telnet to connect
to the host <CODE>daffodil.mit.edu</CODE>, the telnet
program presented her ticket-granting ticket to the KDC and requested a
host ticket for the host
<CODE>daffodil.mit.edu</CODE>.  The KDC sent the host
ticket, which telnet then presented to the host
<CODE>daffodil.mit.edu</CODE>, and she was allowed to
log in without typing her password.


<P>
Suppose your Kerberos tickets allow you to log into a host in another
domain, such as <CODE>trillium.fubar.org</CODE>, which
is also in another Kerberos realm, <CODE>FUBAR.ORG</CODE>.  If you
telnet to this host, you will receive a ticket-granting ticket for the
realm <CODE>FUBAR.ORG</CODE>, plus the new <CODE>host</CODE> ticket for
<CODE>trillium.fubar.org</CODE>.  <KBD>klist</KBD> will now
show:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> klist
Ticket cache: /tmp/krb5cc_ttypa
Default principal: jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal

<H3><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC10">Destroying Your Tickets with kdestroy</A></H3>

<P>
Your Kerberos tickets are proof that you are indeed yourself, and
tickets can be stolen.  If this happens, the person who has them can
masquerade as you until they expire.  For this reason, you should
destroy your Kerberos tickets when you are away from your computer.


<P>
Destroying your tickets is easy.  Simply type <KBD>kdestroy</KBD>.



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> kdestroy
<B>shell%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>kdestroy</CODE> fails to destroy your tickets, it will beep and give
an error message.  For example, if <CODE>kdestroy</CODE> can't find any
tickets to destroy, it will give the following message:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> kdestroy
<B>kdestroy: No credentials cache file found while destroying cache
Ticket cache NOT destroyed!
shell%</B>
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC11">Password Management</A></H2>

<P>
Your password is the only way Kerberos has of verifying your identity.
If someone finds out your password, that person can masquerade as
you--send email that comes from you, read, edit, or delete your files,
or log into other hosts as you--and no one will be able to tell the
difference.  For this reason, it is important that you choose a good
password (see section <A HREF="user-guide.html#SEC13">Password Advice</A>), and keep it secret.  If you need to
give access to your account to someone else, you can do so through
Kerberos.  (See section <A HREF="user-guide.html#SEC14">Granting Access to Your Account</A>.)  You should
<I>never</I> tell your password to anyone, including your system
administrator, for any reason.  You should change your password
frequently, particularly any time you think someone may have found out
what it is.




<H3><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC12">Changing Your Password</A></H3>

<P>
To change your Kerberos password, use the <CODE>kpasswd</CODE> command.  It
will ask you for your old password (to prevent someone else from walking
up to your computer when you're not there and changing your password),
and then prompt you for the new one twice.  (The reason you have to type
it twice is to make sure you have typed it correctly.)  For example,
user <CODE>david</CODE> would do the following:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> kpasswd
<B>Old password for david:</B>    <I>&#60;- Type your old password.</I>
<B>New Password for david:</B>    <I>&#60;- Type your new password.</I>
<B>Verifying, please re-enter New Password for david:</B>  <I>&#60;- Type the new password again.</I>
<B>Password changed.</B>
<B>shell%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
If david typed the incorrect old password, he would get
the following message:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> kpasswd
<B>Old password for david:</B>  <I>&#60;- Type the incorrect old password.</I>
<B>Incorrect old password.
shell%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
If you make a mistake and don't type the new password the same way
twice, <CODE>kpasswd</CODE> will ask you to try again:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> kpasswd
<B>Old password for david:</B>  <I>&#60;- Type the old password.</I>
<B>New Password for david:</B>  <I>&#60;- Type the new password.</I>
<B>Verifying, please re-enter New Password for david:</B> <I>&#60;- Type a different new password.</I>
<B>Mismatch - try again
New Password for david:</B>  <I>&#60;- Type the new password.</I>
<B>Verifying, please re-enter New Password for david:</B> <I>&#60;- Type the same new password.</I>
<B>Password changed.
shell%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
Once you change your password, it takes some time for the change to
propagate through the system.  Depending on how your system is set up,
this might be anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more.  If you
need to get new Kerberos tickets shortly after changing your password,
try the new password.  If the new password doesn't work, try again using
the old one.




<H3><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC13">Password Advice</A></H3>

<P>
Your password can include almost any character you can type (except
control keys and the "enter" key).  A good password is one you can
remember, but that no one else can easily guess.  Examples of <I>bad</I>
passwords are words that can be found in a dictionary, any common or
popular name, especially a famous person (or cartoon character), your
name or username in any form (<I>e.g.</I>, forward, backward, repeated
twice, <I>etc.</I>), your spouse's, child's, or pet's name, your birth
date, your social security number, and any sample password that appears
in this (or any other) manual.


<P>
MIT recommends that your password be at least 6 characters
long, and contain UPPER- and lower-case letters, numbers, and/or
punctuation marks.  Some passwords that would be good if they weren't
listed in this manual include:



<UL>
<LI>some initials, like "GykoR-66." for "Get your kicks on Route

66."

<LI>an easy-to-pronounce nonsense word, like "slaRooBey" or

"krang-its"

<LI>a misspelled phrase, like "2HotPeetzas!" or "ItzAGurl!!!"

</UL>

<P>
Note:  don't actually use any of the above passwords.  They're
only meant to show you how to make up a good password.  Passwords that
appear in a manual are the first ones intruders will try.


<P>
Kerberos V5 allows your system administrators to automatically
reject bad passwords, based on whatever criteria they choose.  For
example, if the user <CODE>jennifer</CODE> chose a bad password,
Kerberos would give an error message like the following:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> kpasswd
<B>Old password for jennifer:</B>  <I>&#60;- Type your old password here.</I>
<B>New Password for jennifer:</B>  <I>&#60;- Type an insecure new password.</I>
<B>Verifying, please re-enter New Password for jennifer:</B>  <I>&#60;- Type it again.</I>

ERROR: Insecure password not accepted.  Please choose another.

kpasswd: Insecure password rejected while attempting to change password.
Please choose another password.

<B>New Password for jennifer:</B>  <I>&#60;- Type a good password here.</I>
<B>Verifying, please re-enter New Password for david:</B>  <I>&#60;- Type it again.</I>
<B>Password changed.
shell%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
Your system administrators can choose the message that is
displayed if you choose a bad password, so the message you see may be
different from the above example.




<H3><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC14">Granting Access to Your Account</A></H3>

<P>
If you need to give someone access to log into your account, you can do
so through Kerberos, without telling the person your password.  Simply
create a file called <CODE>.k5login</CODE> in your home directory.  This file
should contain the Kerberos principal (See section <A HREF="user-guide.html#SEC4">What is a Kerberos Principal?</A>) of each person to whom you wish to give access.  Each
principal must be on a separate line.  Here is a sample <CODE>.k5login</CODE>
file:



<PRE>
jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
david@FUBAR.ORG
</PRE>

<P>
This file would allow the users <CODE>jennifer</CODE> and
<CODE>david</CODE> to use your user ID, provided that they had
Kerberos tickets in their respective realms.  If you will be logging
into other hosts across a network, you will want to include your own
Kerberos principal in your <CODE>.k5login</CODE> file on each of these hosts.


<P>
Using a <CODE>.k5login</CODE> file is much safer than giving out your
password, because:



<UL>
<LI>You can take access away any time simply by removing the principal

from your <CODE>.k5login</CODE> file.

<LI>Although the user has full access to your account on one

particular host (or set of hosts if your <CODE>.k5login</CODE> file is shared,
<I>e.g.</I>, over NFS), that user does not inherit your network privileges.

<LI>Kerberos keeps a log of who obtains tickets, so a system

administrator could find out, if necessary, who was capable of using
your user ID at a particular time.
</UL>

<P>
One common application is to have a <CODE>.k5login</CODE> file in
<CODE>root</CODE>'s home directory, giving root access to that machine to the
Kerberos principals listed.  This allows system administrators to allow
users to become root locally, or to log in remotely as <CODE>root</CODE>,
without their having to give out the root password, and without anyone
having to type the root password over the network.




<H2><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC15">Kerberos V5 Applications</A></H2>

<P>
Kerberos V5 is a <EM>single-sign-on</EM> system.  This means that you
only have to type your password once, and the Kerberos V5 programs
do the authenticating (and optionally encrypting) for you.  The way this
works is that Kerberos has been built into each of a suite of network
programs.  For example, when you use a Kerberos V5 program to
connect to a remote host, the program, the KDC, and the remote host
perform a set of rapid negotiations.  When these negotiations are
completed, your program has proven your identity on your behalf to the
remote host, and the remote host has granted you access, all in the
space of a few seconds.


<P>
The Kerberos V5 applications are versions of existing UNIX network
programs with the Kerberos features added.




<H3><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC16">Overview of Additional Features</A></H3>

<P>
The Kerberos V5 <EM>network programs</EM> are those programs that
connect to another host somewhere on the internet.  These programs
include <CODE>rlogin</CODE>, <CODE>telnet</CODE>, <CODE>ftp</CODE>, <CODE>rsh</CODE>,
<CODE>rcp</CODE>, and <CODE>ksu</CODE>.  These programs have all of the original
features of the corresponding non-Kerberos <CODE>rlogin</CODE>, <CODE>telnet</CODE>,
<CODE>ftp</CODE>, <CODE>rsh</CODE>, <CODE>rcp</CODE>, and <CODE>su</CODE> programs, plus
additional features that transparently use your Kerberos tickets for
negotiating authentication and optional encryption with the remote host.
In most cases, all you'll notice is that you no longer have to type your
password, because Kerberos has already proven your identity.


<P>
The Kerberos V5 network programs allow you the options of forwarding
your tickets to the remote host (if you obtained forwardable tickets
with the <CODE>kinit</CODE> program; see section <A HREF="user-guide.html#SEC8">Obtaining Tickets with kinit</A>), and
encrypting data transmitted between you and the remote host.


<P>
This section of the tutorial assumes you are familiar with the
non-Kerberos versions of these programs, and highlights the Kerberos
functions added in the Kerberos V5 package.




<H3><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC17">telnet</A></H3>

<P>
The Kerberos V5 <CODE>telnet</CODE> command works exactly like the
standard UNIX telnet program, with the following Kerberos options added:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>-f, --forward</KBD>
<DD>
forwards a copy of your tickets to the remote host.

<DT><KBD>--noforward</KBD>
<DD>
turns off forwarding of tickets to the remote host.  (This option
overrides any forwarding specified in your machine's configuration
files.)

<DT><KBD>-F, --forwardable</KBD>
<DD>
forwards a copy of your tickets to the remote host, and marks them
re-forwardable from the remote host.

<DT><KBD>--noforwardable</KBD>
<DD>
makes any forwarded tickets nonforwardable.  (This option overrides any
forwardability specified in your machine's configuration files.)

<DT><KBD>-k <I>realm</I></KBD>
<DD>
requests tickets for the remote host in the specified realm, instead of
determining the realm itself.

<DT><KBD>-K</KBD>
<DD>
uses your tickets to authenticate to the remote host, but does not log
you in.

<DT><KBD>-a</KBD>
<DD>
attempt automatic login using your tickets.  <CODE>telnet</CODE> will assume
the same username unless you explicitly specify another.

<DT><KBD>-x, --encrypt</KBD>
<DD>
turns on encryption.

<DT><KBD>--noencrypt</KBD>
<DD>
turns off encryption.

<P>
For example, if <CODE>david</CODE> wanted to use the standard
UNIX telnet to connect to the machine

<H3><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC19">FTP</A></H3>

<P>
The Kerberos V5 <CODE>FTP</CODE> program works exactly like the standard
UNIX FTP program, with the following Kerberos features added:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>-k <I>realm</I></KBD>
<DD>
requests tickets for the remote host in the specified realm, instead of
determining the realm itself.

<DT><KBD>-forward</KBD>
<DD>
requests that your tickets be forwarded to the remote host.  The
<KBD>-forward</KBD> argument must be the last argument on the command line.

<DT><KBD>protect <I>level</I></KBD>
<DD>
(issued at the <CODE>ftp&#62;</CODE> prompt) sets the protection level.  "Clear"
is no protection; "safe" ensures data integrity by verifying the
checksum, and "private" encrypts the data.  Encryption also ensures
data integrity.
</DL>

<P>
For example, suppose <CODE>jennifer</CODE> wants to get her
<CODE>RMAIL</CODE> file from the directory <CODE>~jennifer/Mail</CODE>,
on the host <CODE>daffodil.mit.edu</CODE>.  She wants

The Kerberos V5 <CODE>rsh</CODE> program works exactly like the standard
UNIX rlogin program, with the following Kerberos features added:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>-f, --forward</KBD>
<DD>

<DD>
requests tickets for the remote host in the specified realm, instead of

</DL>

<P>
For example, if you wanted to copy the file <CODE>/etc/motd</CODE> from the

directory, via an encrypted connection, you would simply type:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> rcp -x daffodil.mit.edu:/etc/motd .

<P>
The <KBD>rcp</KBD> program negotiates authentication and encryption
transparently.  The full set of options to Kerberos V5 <CODE>rcp</CODE>

<H3><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC22">ksu</A></H3>

<P>
The Kerberos V5 <CODE>ksu</CODE> program replaces the standard UNIX su
program.  <CODE>ksu</CODE> first authenticates you to Kerberos.  Depending on
the configuration of your system, <CODE>ksu</CODE> may ask for your Kerberos
password if authentication fails.  <EM>Note that you should never type
your password if you are remotely logged in using an unencrypted
connection.</EM>


<P>
Once <CODE>ksu</CODE> has authenticated you, if your Kerberos principal
appears in the target's <CODE>.k5login</CODE> file (see section <A HREF="user-guide.html#SEC14">Granting Access to Your Account</A>) or in the target's <CODE>.k5users</CODE> file (see below), it
switches your user ID to the target user ID.


<P>
For example, <CODE>david</CODE> has put
<CODE>jennifer</CODE>'s Kerberos principal in his <CODE>.k5login</CODE>
file.  If <CODE>jennifer</CODE> uses <CODE>ksu</CODE> to become
<CODE>david</CODE>, the exchange would look like this.  (To
differentiate between the two shells, <CODE>jennifer</CODE>'s
prompt is represented as <CODE>jennifer%</CODE> and
<CODE>david</CODE>'s prompt is represented as
<CODE>david%</CODE>.)



<PRE>

david%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>jennifer</CODE> had not appeared in
<CODE>david</CODE>'s <CODE>.k5login</CODE> file (and the system was
configured to ask for a password), the exchange would have looked like
this (assuming <CODE>david</CODE> has taken appropriate
precautions in protecting his password):



<PRE>
<B>jennifer%</B> ksu david
<B>WARNING: Your password may be exposed if you enter it here and are logged 
         in remotely using an unsecure (non-encrypted) channel. 
Kerberos password for david@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:</B>  <I>&#60;-  <CODE>jennifer</CODE> types the wrong password here.</I>
<B>ksu: Password incorrect
Authentication failed.
jennifer%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
Now, suppose <CODE>david</CODE> did not want to give
<CODE>jennifer</CODE> full access to his account, but wanted to
give her permission to list his files and use the "more" command to view
them.  He could create a <CODE>.k5users</CODE> file giving her permission to
run only those specific commands.


<P>
The <CODE>.k5users</CODE> file is like the <CODE>.k5login</CODE> file, except that
each principal is optionally followed by a list of commands.  <CODE>ksu</CODE>
will let those principals execute only the commands listed, using the
<KBD>-e</KBD> option.  <CODE>david</CODE>'s <CODE>.k5users</CODE> file
might look like the following:



<PRE>
jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU       /bin/ls /usr/bin/more
joeadmin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU         /bin/ls
joeadmin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU   *
david@FUBAR.ORG
</PRE>

<P>
The above <CODE>.k5users</CODE> file would let
<CODE>jennifer</CODE> run only the commands <CODE>/bin/ls</CODE> and
<CODE>/usr/bin/more</CODE>.  It would let <CODE>joeadmin</CODE> run only
the command <CODE>/bin/ls</CODE> if he had regular tickets, but if he had
tickets for his <CODE>admin</CODE> instance,
<CODE>joeadmin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU</CODE>, he would be able
to execute any command.  The last line gives <CODE>david</CODE>
in the realm FUBAR.ORG permission to execute any command.
(<I>I.e.</I>, having only a Kerberos principal on a line is equivalent to
giving that principal permission to execute <CODE>*</CODE>.)  This is so that
david can allow himself to execute commands when he logs
in, using Kerberos, from a machine in the realm FUBAR.ORG.


<P>
Then, when <CODE>jennifer</CODE> wanted to list his home directory,
she would type:



<PRE>
<B>jennifer%</B> ksu david -e ls ~david
<B>Authenticated jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
Account david: authorization for jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU for execution of
               /bin/ls successful
Changing uid to david (3382)
Mail            News            Personal        misc            bin
jennifer%</B>
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>jennifer</CODE> had tried to give a different
command to <CODE>ksu</CODE>, it would have prompted for a password as with the
previous example.


<P>
Note that unless the <CODE>.k5users</CODE> file gives the target permission to
run any command, the user must use <CODE>ksu</CODE> with the <KBD>-e</KBD>
<I>command</I> option.


<P>
The <CODE>ksu</CODE> options you are most likely to use are:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>-n <I>principal</I></KBD>
<DD>
specifies which Kerberos principal you want to use for <CODE>ksu</CODE>.
(<I>e.g.</I>, the user <CODE>joeadmin</CODE> might want to use his
<CODE>admin</CODE> instance.  See section <A HREF="user-guide.html#SEC3">What is a Ticket?</A>.)

<DT><KBD>-c</KBD>
<DD>
specifies the location of your Kerberos credentials cache (ticket file).

<DT><KBD>-C</KBD>
<DD>
specifies the location you want the Kerberos credentials cache (ticket
file) to be for the target user ID.

<DT><KBD>-k</KBD>
<DD>
tells <CODE>ksu</CODE> not to destroy your Kerberos tickets when <CODE>ksu</CODE> is
finished.

<DT><KBD>-f</KBD>
<DD>
requests forwardable tickets.  (See section <A HREF="user-guide.html#SEC8">Obtaining Tickets with kinit</A>.)  This
is only applicable if <CODE>ksu</CODE> needs to obtain tickets.

<DT><KBD>-l <I>lifetime</I></KBD>
<DD>
sets the ticket lifetime.  (See section <A HREF="user-guide.html#SEC8">Obtaining Tickets with kinit</A>.)  This is
only applicable if <CODE>ksu</CODE> needs to obtain tickets.

<DT><KBD>-z</KBD>
<DD>
tells <CODE>ksu</CODE> to copy your Kerberos tickets only if the UID you are
switching is the same as the Kerberos primary (either yours or the one
specified by the <KBD>-n</KBD> option).

<DT><KBD>-Z</KBD>
<DD>
tells <CODE>ksu</CODE> not to copy any Kerberos tickets to the new UID.

<DT><KBD>-e <I>command</I></KBD>
<DD>
tells <CODE>ksu</CODE> to execute <I>command</I> and then exit.  See the
description of the <CODE>.k5users</CODE> file above.

<DT><KBD>-a <I>text</I></KBD>
<DD>
(at the end of the command line) tells <CODE>ksu</CODE> to pass everything
after <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> to the target shell.

<P>
The full set of options to Kerberos V5 <CODE>ksu</CODE> are discussed
in the Reference section of this manual.  (see section <A HREF="user-guide.html#SEC33">ksu Reference</A>)




<H1><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="user-guide_toc.html#TOC23">Kerberos V5 Reference</A></H1>

<P>
This section will include copies of the manual pages for the
Kerberos V5 client programs.  You can read the manual entry for any
command by typing <CODE>man</CODE> <I>command</I>, where <I>command</I> is the name
of the command for which you want to read the manual entry.  For
example, to read the <CODE>kinit</CODE> manual entry, you would type:



<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> man kinit
</PRE>

<P>
Note:  To be able to view the Kerberos V5 manual pages on line, you
may need to add the directory <CODE>/usr/local/man</CODE> to your MANPATH
environment variable.  (Remember to replace <CODE>/usr/local</CODE> with
the top-level directory in which Kerberos V5 is installed.)  For
example, if you had the the following line in your <CODE>.login</CODE>
file<A NAME="DOCF2" HREF="user-guide_foot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>:



<PRE>
setenv MANPATH /usr/local/man:/usr/man
</PRE>

<P>
and the Kerberos V5 man pages were in the directory
<CODE>/usr/krb5/man</CODE>, you would change the line to the following:



<PRE>
setenv MANPATH /usr/krb5/man:/usr/local/man:/usr/man
</PRE>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>client</B>
<DD>
an entity that can obtain a ticket.  This entity is usually either a
user or a host.

<DT><B>host</B>
<DD>
a computer that can be accessed over a network.

<DT><B>Kerberos</B>
<DD>
in Greek mythology, the three-headed dog that guards the entrance to the
underworld.  In the computing world, Kerberos is a network security
package that was developed at MIT.

<DT><B>KDC</B>
<DD>
Key Distribution Center.  A machine that issues Kerberos tickets.

<DT><B>keytab</B>
<DD>
a <B>key tab</B>le file containing one or more keys.  A host or service
uses a <EM>keytab</EM> file in much the same way as a user uses his/her
password.

<DT><B>principal</B>
<DD>
a string that names a specific entity to which a set of credentials may
be assigned.  It generally has three parts:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>primary</B>
<DD>
the first part of a Kerberos <I>principal</I>.  In the case of a user, it
is the username.  In the case of a service, it is the name of the
service.

<DT><B>instance</B>
<DD>
the second part of a Kerberos <I>principal</I>.  It gives information that
qualifies the primary.  The instance may be null.  In the case of a
user, the instance is often used to describe the intended use of the
corresponding credentials.  In the case of a host, the instance is the
fully qualified hostname.

<DT><B>realm</B>
<DD>
the logical network served by a single Kerberos database and a set of
Key Distribution Centers.  By convention, realm names are generally all
uppercase letters, to differentiate the realm from the internet domain.
</DL>

The typical format of a typical Kerberos principal is
primary/instance@REALM.

<DT><B>service</B>
<DD>
any program or computer you access over a network.  Examples of services
include "host" (a host, <I>e.g.</I>, when you use <CODE>telnet</CODE> and
<CODE>rsh</CODE>), "ftp" (FTP), "krbtgt" (authentication;
cf. <I>ticket-granting ticket</I>), and "pop" (email).

<DT><B>ticket</B>
<DD>
a temporary set of electronic credentials that verify the identity of a
client for a particular service.

<DT><B>TGT</B>
<DD>
Ticket-Granting Ticket.  A special Kerberos ticket that permits the
client to obtain additional Kerberos tickets within the same Kerberos
realm.
