Create the Database
...................

You will use the `kdb5_util' command *on the Master KDC* to create the
Kerberos database and the optional stash file.  The "stash file" is a
local copy of the master key that resides in encrypted form on the
KDC's local disk.  The stash file is used to authenticate the KDC to
itself automatically before starting the `kadmind' and `krb5kdc'
daemons (e.g., as part of the machine's boot sequence).  The stash
file, like the keytab file (see *Note The Keytab File::, for more
information) is a potential point-of-entry for a break-in, and if
compromised, would allow unrestricted access to the Kerberos database.
If you choose to install a stash file, it should be readable only by
root, and should exist only on the KDC's local disk.  The file should
not be part of any backup of the machine, unless access to the backup
data is secured as tightly as access to the master password itself.

Note that `kdb5_util' will prompt you for the master key for the
Kerberos database.  This key can be any string.  A good key is one you
can remember, but that no one else can guess.  Examples of bad keys are
words that can be found in a dictionary, any common or popular name,
especially a famous person (or cartoon character), your username in any
form (e.g., forward, backward, repeated twice, etc.), and any of the
sample keys that appear in this manual.  One example of a key which
might be good if it did not appear in this manual is "MITiys4K5!",
which represents the sentence "MIT is your source for Kerberos 5!"
(It's the first letter of each word, substituting the numeral "4" for
the word "for", and includes the punctuation mark at the end.)

The following is an example of how to create a Kerberos database and
stash file on the master KDC, using the `kdb5_util' command.  (The line
that begins with => is a continuation of the previous line.)  Replace
ATHENA.MIT.EDU with the name of your Kerberos realm.

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util create -r ATHENA.MIT.EDU -s
     Initializing database '/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/principal' for
     => realm 'ATHENA.MIT.EDU',
     master key name 'K/M@ATHENA.MIT.EDU'
     You will be prompted for the database Master Password.
     It is important that you NOT FORGET this password.
     Enter KDC database master key:  <= Type the master password.
     Re-enter KDC database master key to verify:  <= Type it again.
     shell%

This will create five files in the directory specified in your
`kdc.conf' file:  two Kerberos database files, `principal.db', and
`principal.ok'; the Kerberos administrative database file,
`principal.kadm5'; the administrative database lock file,
`principal.kadm5.lock'; and the stash file, `.k5stash'.  (The default
directory is `/usr/local/var/krb5kdc'.)  If you do not want a stash
file, run the above command without the `-s' option.

Add Administrators to the Acl File
..................................

Next, you need create an Access Control List (acl) file, and put the
Kerberos principal of at least one of the administrators into it.  The
filename should match the value you have set for "acl_file" in your
`kdc.conf' file.  The default file name is `kadm5.acl'.  The format of
the file is:

     Kerberos principal      permissions     optional target principal

The Kerberos principal (and optional target principal) can include the
"*" wildcard, so if you want any principal with the instance "admin" to
have full permissions on the database, you could use the principal
"`*/admin@REALM'" where "REALM" is your Kerberos realm.

Note:  a common use of an admin instance is so you can grant separate
permissions (such as administrator access to the Kerberos database) to
a separate Kerberos principal.  For example, the user `joeadmin' might
have a principal for his administrative use, called `joeadmin/admin'.
This way, `joeadmin' would obtain `joeadmin/admin' tickets only when he
actually needs to use those permissions.  Refer to the Kerberos V5
Administrator's Guide or the Kerberos V5 User's Guide for more detailed
explanations of "principals" and "instances".

The permissions (acls) recognized in the acl file are the following:

a
     allows the addition of principals or policies in the database.

A
     prohibits the addition of principals or policies in the database.

d
     allows the deletion of principals or policies in the database.

D
     prohibits the deletion of principals or policies in the database.

m
     allows the modification of principals or policies in the database.

M
     prohibits the modification of principals or policies in the
     database.

c
     allows the changing of passwords for principals in the database.

C
     prohibits the changing of passwords for principals in the database.

i
     allows inquiries to the database.

I
     prohibits inquiries to the database.

l
     allows the listing of principals or policies in the database.

L
     prohibits the listing of principals or policies in the database.

*
     Short for all privileges (admcil).

x
     Short for all privileges (admcil); identical to "*".

To give the principal `*/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU' permission to change all
of the database permissions on any principal permissions, you would
place the following line in the file:

     */admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU  *

To give the principal `joeadmin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU' permission to add,
list, and inquire about any principal that has the instance "root", you
would add the following line to the acl file:

     joeadmin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU  ali  */root@ATHENA.MIT.EDU

Add Administrators to the Kerberos Database
...........................................

Next you need to add administrative principals to the Kerberos database.
(You must add at least one now.)  To do this, use `kadmin.local' *on
the master KDC*.  The administrative principals you create should be
the ones you added to the ACL file.  (See *Note Add Administrators to
the Acl File::.)  In the following example, the administration
principal `admin/admin' is created:

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/kadmin.local
     kadmin.local: addprinc admin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     WARNING: no policy specified for "admin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU";
     defaulting to no policy.
     Enter password for principal admin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:  <= Enter a password.
     Re-enter password for principal admin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:  <= Type it again.
     Principal "admin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU" created.
     kadmin.local:


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Create a kadmind Keytab,  Next: Start the Kerberos Daemons,  Prev: Add Administrators to the Kerberos Database,  Up: Install the Master KDC

Create a kadmind Keytab
.......................

The kadmind keytab is the key that kadmind will use to decrypt
administrators' Kerberos tickets to determine whether or not it should
give them access to the database.  You need to create the kadmin keytab
with entries for the principals `kadmin/admin' and `kadmin/changepw'.
(These principals are placed in the Kerberos database automatically
when you create it.)  To create the kadmin keytab, run `kadmin.local'
and use the `ktadd' command, as in the following example.  (The line
beginning with => is a continuation of the previous line.):

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/kadmin.local
     kadmin.local: ktadd -k /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab
     => kadmin/admin kadmin/changepw
     Entry for principal kadmin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU with
          kvno 3, encryption type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab
          WRFILE:/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab.
     Entry for principal kadmin/changepw@ATHENA.MIT.EDU with
          kvno 3, encryption type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab
          WRFILE:/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab.
     kadmin.local: quit
     shell%

As specified in the `-k' argument, `ktadd' will save the extracted
keytab as
`/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab'.  The filename you use must be
the one specified in your `kdc.conf' file.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Start the Kerberos Daemons,  Prev: Create a kadmind Keytab,  Up: Install the Master KDC

Start the Kerberos Daemons on the Master KDC
............................................

At this point, you are ready to start the Kerberos daemons on the Master
KDC.  To do so, type:

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/krb5kdc
     shell% /usr/local/sbin/kadmind

Each daemon will fork and run in the background.  Assuming you want
these daemons to start up automatically at boot time, you can add them
to the KDC's `/etc/rc' or `/etc/inittab' file.  You need to have a
stash file in order to do this.

You can verify that they started properly by checking for their startup
messages in the logging locations you defined in `/etc/krb5.conf'.
(See *Note Edit the Configuration Files::.)  For example:

     shell% tail /var/log/krb5kdc.log
     Dec 02 12:35:47 beeblebrox krb5kdc[3187](info): commencing operation
     shell% tail /var/log/kadmin.log
     Dec 02 12:35:52 beeblebrox kadmind[3189](info): starting

Any errors the daemons encounter while starting will also be listed in
the logging output.

----------------------

You are now ready to start configuring the slave KDCs.  Assuming you are
setting the KDCs up so that you can easily switch the master KDC with
one of the slaves, you should perform each of these steps on the master
KDC as well as the slave KDCs, unless these instructions specify
otherwise.

Create Host Keys for the Slave KDCs
...................................

Each KDC needs a host principal in the Kerberos database.  You can enter
these from any host, once the `kadmind' daemon is running.  For
example, if your master KDC were called kerberos.mit.edu, and you had
two KDC slaves named kerberos-1.mit.edu and kerberos-2.mit.edu, you
would type the following:

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/kadmin
     kadmin: addprinc -randkey host/kerberos.mit.edu
     WARNING: no policy specified for "host/kerberos.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU";
     defaulting to no policy.
     Principal "host/kerberos.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU" created.
     kadmin: addprinc -randkey host/kerberos-1.mit.edu
     WARNING: no policy specified for "host/kerberos-1.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU";
     defaulting to no policy.
     Principal "host/kerberos-1.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU" created.
     kadmin: addprinc -randkey host/kerberos-2.mit.edu
     WARNING: no policy specified for "host/kerberos-2.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU";
     defaulting to no policy.
     Principal "host/kerberos-2.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU" created.
     kadmin:

It is not actually necessary to have the master KDC server in the
Kerberos database, but it can be handy if:

   * anyone will be logging into the machine as something other than
     root

   * you want to be able to swap the master KDC with one of the slaves
     if necessary.

Extract Host Keytabs for the KDCs
.................................

Each KDC (including the master) needs a keytab to decrypt tickets.
Ideally, you should extract each keytab locally on its own KDC.  If this
is not feasible, you should use an encrypted session to send them across
the network.  To extract a keytab on a KDC called kerberos.mit.edu, you
would execute the following command:

     kadmin: ktadd host/kerberos.mit.edu
     kadmin: Entry for principal host/kerberos.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU with
          kvno 1, encryption type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab
          WRFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.
     kadmin:

Note that the principal must exist in the Kerberos database in order to
extract the keytab.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Set Up the Slave KDCs for Database Propagation,  Prev: Extract Host Keytabs for the KDCs,  Up: Install the Slave KDCs

Set Up the Slave KDCs for Database Propagation
..............................................

The database is propagated from the master KDC to the slave KDCs via the
`kpropd' daemon.  To set up propagation, create a file on each KDC,
named `/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kpropd.acl', containing the principals
for each of the KDCs.  For example, if the master KDC were
`kerberos.mit.edu', the slave KDCs were `kerberos-1.mit.edu' and
`kerberos-2.mit.edu', and the realm were `ATHENA.MIT.EDU', then the
file's contents would be:

     host/kerberos.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     host/kerberos-1.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     host/kerberos-2.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU

Then, add the following lines to `/etc/inetd.conf' file on each KDC
(the line beginnng with => is a continuation of the previous line):

     krb5_prop stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/sbin/kpropd kpropd
     eklogin   stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/sbin/klogind
     => klogind -k -c -e

The first line sets up the `kpropd' database propagation daemon.  The
second line sets up the `eklogin' daemon, allowing
Kerberos-authenticated, encrypted rlogin to the KDC.

You also need to add the following lines to `/etc/services' on each KDC:

     kerberos        88/udp      kdc       # Kerberos authentication (udp)
     kerberos        88/tcp      kdc       # Kerberos authentication (tcp)
     krb5_prop       754/tcp               # Kerberos slave propagation
     kerberos-adm    749/tcp               # Kerberos 5 admin/changepw (tcp)
     kerberos-adm    749/udp               # Kerberos 5 admin/changepw (udp)
     eklogin         2105/tcp              # Kerberos encrypted rlogin

Back on the Master KDC
----------------------

Now that the slave KDCs are able to accept database propagation, you'll
need to propagate the database to each of them.

* Menu:

* Propagate the Database to Each Slave KDC::


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Propagate the Database to Each Slave KDC,  Prev: Back on the Master KDC,  Up: Back on the Master KDC

Propagate the Database to Each Slave KDC
........................................

First, create a dump of the database on the master KDC, as follows:

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util dump /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans
     shell%

Next, you need to manually propagate the database to each slave KDC, as
in the following example.  (The lines beginning with => are
continuations of the previous line.):

     /usr/local/sbin/kprop -f /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans
     => kerberos-1.mit.edu
     /usr/local/sbin/kprop -f /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans
     => kerberos-2.mit.edu

You will need a script to dump and propagate the database.  The
following is an example of a bourne shell script that will do this.
(Note that the line that begins with => is a continuation of the
previous line.  Remember that you need to replace /usr/local with the
name of the directory in which you installed Kerberos V5.)

     #!/bin/sh
     
     kdclist = "kerberos-1.mit.edu kerberos-2.mit.edu"
     
     /usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util -R "dump
     => /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans"
     
     for kdc in $kdclist
     do
     /usr/local/sbin/kprop -f /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans $kdc
     done

You will need to set up a cron job to run this script at the intervals
you decided on earlier (*Note Database Propagation::.)

--------------------------------

Now that the slave KDCs have copies of the Kerberos database, you can
create stash files for them and start the `krb5kdc' daemon.

* Menu:

* Create Stash Files on the Slave KDCs::
* Start the krb5kdc Daemon on Each KDC::

Create Stash Files on the Slave KDCs
....................................

Create stash files, by issuing the following commands on each slave KDC:

     shell% kdb5_util stash
     kdb5_util: Cannot find/read stored master key while reading master key
     kdb5_util: Warning: proceeding without master key
     Enter KDC database master key:  <= Enter the database master key.
     shell%

As mentioned above, the stash file is necessary for your KDCs to be able
authenticate to themselves, such as when they reboot.  You could run
your KDCs without stash files, but you would then need to type in the
Kerberos database master key by hand every time you start a KDC daemon.

Start the krb5kdc Daemon on Each KDC
....................................

The final step in configuing your slave KDCs is to run the KDC daemon:

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/krb5kdc

As with the master KDC, you will probably want to add this command to
the KDCs' `/etc/rc' or `/etc/inittab' files, so they will start the
krb5kdc daemon automatically at boot time.

Add Kerberos Principals to the Database
---------------------------------------

Once your KDCs are set up and running, you are ready to use `kadmin' to
load principals for your users, hosts, and other services into the
Kerberos database.  This procedure is described fully in the "Adding or
Modifying Principals" section of the Kerberos V5 System Administrator's
Guide.  (*Note Create Host Keys for the Slave KDCs::, for a brief
description.)  The keytab is generated by running `kadmin' and issuing
the `ktadd' command.

Limit Access to the KDCs
------------------------

To limit the possibility that your Kerberos database could be
compromised, MIT recommends that each KDC be a dedicated host, with
limited access.  If your KDC is also a file server, FTP server, Web
server, or even just a client machine, someone who obtained root access
through a security hole in any of those areas could gain access to the
Kerberos database.

MIT recommends that your KDCs use the following `/etc/inetd.conf' file.
(Note:  each line beginning with => is a continuation of the previous
line.):

     #
     # Configuration file for inetd(1M).  See inetd.conf(4).
     #
     # To re-configure the running inetd process, edit this file, then
     # send the inetd process a SIGHUP.

Switching Master and Slave KDCs
-------------------------------

You may occasionally want to use one of your slave KDCs as the master.
This might happen if you are upgrading the master KDC, or if your master
KDC has a disk crash.

Assuming you have configured all of your KDCs to be able to function as
either the master KDC or a slave KDC (as this document recommends), all
you need to do to make the changeover is:

If the master KDC is still running, do the following on the *old*
master KDC:

  1. Kill the `kadmind' process.

  2. Disable the cron job that propagates the database.

  3. Run your database propagation script manually, to ensure that the
     slaves all have the latest copy of the database.  (*Note Propagate
     the Database to Each Slave KDC::.)  As of the 1.2.2 release, it is
     no longer necessary to use "kdb5_util dump -ov" in order to
     preserve per-principal policy information, as the default dump
     format now supports it.  Note you should update your slaves prior
     to your master, so that they will understand the new dump format.
     (This is a good policy anyway.)

On the *new* master KDC:

  1. Create a database keytab.  (*Note Create a kadmind Keytab::.)

  2. Start the `kadmind' daemon.  (*Note Start the Kerberos Daemons::.)

  3. Set up the cron job to propagate the database.  (*Note Propagate
     the Database to Each Slave KDC::.)

  4. Switch the CNAMEs of the old and new master KDCs.  (If you don't do
     this, you'll need to change the `krb5.conf' file on every client
     machine in your Kerberos realm.)

File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Client Programs,  Next: Client Machine Configuration Files,  Prev: Installing and Configuring UNIX Client Machines,  Up: Installing and Configuring UNIX Client Machines

Client Programs
---------------

The Kerberized client programs are `login.krb5', `rlogin', `telnet',
`ftp', `rcp', `rsh', `kinit', `klist', `kdestroy', `kpasswd', `ksu', and
`krb524init'.  All of these programs are in the directory
`/usr/local/bin', except for `login.krb5' which is in `/usr/local/sbin'.

You will probably want to have your users put `/usr/local/bin' ahead of
`/bin' and `/usr/bin' in their paths, so they will by default get the
Kerberos V5 versions of `rlogin', `telnet', `ftp', `rcp', and `rsh'.

MIT recommends that you use `login.krb5' in place of `/bin/login' to
give your users a single-sign-on system.  You will need to make sure
your users know to use their Kerberos passwords when they log in.

You will also need to educate your users to use the ticket management
programs `kinit', `klist', `kdestroy', and to use the Kerberos programs
`ksu', and `kpasswd' in place of their non-Kerberos counterparts `su',
`passwd', and `rdist'.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Client Machine Configuration Files,  Prev: Client Programs,  Up: Installing and Configuring UNIX Client Machines

Client Machine Configuration Files
----------------------------------

Each machine running Kerberos must have a `/etc/krb5.conf' file.
(*Note krb5.conf::)

Also, for most UNIX systems, you must add the appropriate Kerberos
services to each client machine's `/etc/services' file.  If you are
using the default configuration for Kerberos V5, you should be able to
just insert the following code:

     #
     # Note --- if you are using Kerberos V4 and you either:
     #
     #    (a) haven't converted all your master or slave KDCs to V5, or
     #
     #    (b) are worried about inter-realm interoperability with other KDC's
     #        that are still using V4
     #

As described in the comments in the above code, if your master KDC or
any of your slave KDCs is running Kerberos V4, (or if you will be
authenticating to any Kerberos V4 KDCs in another realm) you will need
to switch the port number for `kerberos' to 750 and create a
`kerberos-sec' service (tcp and udp) on port 88, so the Kerberos V4
KDC(s) will continue to work properly.

Mac OS X Configuration
......................

To install Kerberos V5 on Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server, follow the
directions for generic Unix-based OS's, except for the `/etc/services'
updates described above.

Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server use a database called NetInfo to store the
contents of files normally found in `/etc'.  Instead of modifying
`/etc/services', you should run the following commands to add the
Kerberos service entries to NetInfo:

     $ niutil -create . /services/kerberos
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kerberos name kerberos kdc
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kerberos port 750
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kerberos protocol tcp udp
     $ niutil -create . /services/krbupdate
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/krbupdate name krbupdate kreg
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/krbupdate port 760
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/krbupdate protocol tcp
     $ niutil -create . /services/kpasswd
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kpasswd name kpasswd kpwd
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kpasswd port 761
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kpasswd protocol tcp
     $ niutil -create . /services/klogin
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/klogin port 543
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/klogin protocol tcp
     $ niutil -create . /services/eklogin
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/eklogin port 2105
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/eklogin protocol tcp
     $ niutil -create . /services/kshell
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kshell name kshell krcmd
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kshell port 544
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kshell protocol tcp

In addition to adding services to NetInfo, you must also modify the
resolver configuration in NetInfo so that the machine resolves its own
hostname as a FQDN (fully qualified domain name).  By default, Mac OS X
and Mac OS X Server machines query NetInfo to resolve hostnames before
falling back to DNS.  Because NetInfo has an unqualified name for all
the machines in the NetInfo database, the machine's own hostname will
resolve to an unqualified name.  Kerberos needs a FQDN to look up keys
in the machine's keytab file.

Fortunately, you can change the `lookupd' caching order to query DNS
first.  Run the following NetInfo commands and reboot the machine:

     $ niutil -create . /locations/lookupd/hosts
     $ niutil -createprop . /locations/lookupd/hosts LookupOrder CacheAgent DNSAgent
      NIAgent NILAgent

Once you have rebooted, you can verify that the resolver now behaves
correctly.  Compile the Kerberos 5 distribution and run:

     $ cd .../src/tests/resolve
     $ ./resolve

This will tell you whether or not your machine returns FQDNs on name
lookups.  If the test still fails, you can also try turning off DNS
caching.  Run the following commands and reboot:

     $ niutil -create . /locations/lookupd/hosts
     $ niutil -createprop . /locations/lookupd/hosts LookupOrder DNSAgent
      CacheAgent NIAgent NILAgent

The remainder of the setup of a Mac OS X client machine or application
server should be the same as for other UNIX-based systems.

UNIX Application Servers
========================

An application server is a host that provides one or more services over
the network.  Application servers can be "secure" or "insecure."  A
"secure" host is set up to require authentication from every client
connecting to it.  An "insecure" host will still provide Kerberos
authentication, but will also allow unauthenticated clients to connect.

If you have Kerberos V5 installed on all of your client machines,
MIT recommends that you make your hosts secure, to take advantage of
the security that Kerberos authentication affords.  However, if you
have some clients that do not have Kerberos V5 installed, you can run
an insecure server, and still take advantage of Kerberos V5's single
sign-on on capability.

Server Programs
---------------

Just as Kerberos V5 provided its own Kerberos-enhanced versions of
client UNIX network programs, Kerberos V5 also provides
Kerberos-enhanced versions of server UNIX network daemons.  These are
`ftpd', `klogind', `kshd', and `telnetd'.  These programs are installed
in the directory `/usr/local/sbin'.  You may want to add this directory
to root's path.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Server Configuration Files,  Next: The Keytab File,  Prev: Server Programs,  Up: UNIX Application Servers

Server Configuration Files
--------------------------

For a *secure* server, make the following changes to `/etc/inetd.conf':

Find and comment out any lines for the services `ftp', `telnet',
`shell', `login', and `exec'.

Add the following lines.  (Note:  each line beginning with => is a
continuation of the previous line.)

     klogin  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/local/sbin/klogind
     => klogind -k -c
     eklogin stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/local/sbin/klogind
     => klogind -k -c -e
     kshell  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/local/sbin/kshd

     => ftpd -a
     telnet  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/local/sbin/telnetd
     => telnetd -a valid

For an *insecure* server, make the following changes instead to
`/etc/inetd.conf':

Find and comment out any lines for the services `ftp' and `telnet'.

Add the following lines.  (Note:  each line beginning with => is a
continuation of the previous line.)
     klogin  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/local/sbin/klogind
     => klogind -k -c

     => telnetd -a none


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: The Keytab File,  Next: Some Advice about Secure Hosts,  Prev: Server Configuration Files,  Up: UNIX Application Servers

The Keytab File
---------------

All Kerberos server machines need a "keytab" file, called
`/etc/krb5.keytab', to authenticate to the KDC.  The keytab file is an
encrypted, local, on-disk copy of the host's key.  The keytab file,
like the stash file (*Note Create the Database::) is a potential
point-of-entry for a break-in, and if compromised, would allow
unrestricted access to its host.  The keytab file should be readable
only by root, and should exist only on the machine's local disk.  The
file should not be part of any backup of the machine, unless access to
the backup data is secured as tightly as access to the machine's root
password itself.

In order to generate a keytab for a host, the host must have a principal
in the Kerberos database.  The procedure for adding hosts to the
database is described fully in the "Adding or Modifying Principals"
section of the `Kerberos V5 System Administrator's Guide'.  *Note
Create Host Keys for the Slave KDCs:: for a brief description.)  The
keytab is generated by running `kadmin' and issuing the `ktadd' command.

For example, to generate a keytab file to allow the host
trillium.mit.edu to authenticate for the services `host', `ftp', and
`pop', the administrator `joeadmin' would issue the command (on
trillium.mit.edu):

     trillium% /usr/local/sbin/kadmin
     kadmin5: ktadd host/trillium.mit.edu ftp/trillium.mit.edu
     => pop/trillium.mit.edu
     kadmin: Entry for principal host/trillium.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU with
     kvno 3, encryption type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab
     WRFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.
     kadmin: Entry for principal ftp/trillium.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU with
     kvno 3, encryption type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab
     WRFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.
     kadmin: Entry for principal pop/trillium.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU with
     kvno 3, encryption type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab
     WRFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.
     kadmin5: quit
     trillium%

If you generate the keytab file on another host, you need to get a copy
of the keytab file onto the destination host (`trillium', in the above
example) without sending it unencrypted over the network.  If you have
installed the Kerberos V5 client programs, you can use encrypted `rcp'.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Some Advice about Secure Hosts,  Prev: The Keytab File,  Up: UNIX Application Servers

Some Advice about Secure Hosts
------------------------------

Kerberos V5 can protect your host from certain types of break-ins, but
it is possible to install Kerberos V5 and still leave your host
vulnerable to attack.  Obviously an installation guide is not the place
to try to include an exhaustive list of countermeasures for every
possible attack, but it is worth noting some of the larger holes and how
to close them.

As stated earlier in this section, MIT recommends that on a secure
host, you disable the standard `ftp', `login', `telnet', `shell', and
`exec' services in `/etc/inetd.conf'.  We also recommend that secure
hosts have an empty `/etc/hosts.equiv' file and that there not be a
`.rhosts' file in `root''s home directory.  You can grant
Kerberos-authenticated root access to specific Kerberos principals by
placing those principals in the file `.k5login' in root's home
directory.

We recommend that backups of secure machines exclude the keytab file
(`/etc/krb5.keytab').  If this is not possible, the backups should at
least be done locally, rather than over a network, and the backup tapes
should be physically secured.

Finally, the keytab file and any programs run by root, including the
Kerberos V5 binaries, should be kept on local disk.  The keytab file
should be readable only by root.

Upgrading Existing Kerberos V5 Installations
********************************************

If you already have an existing Kerberos database that you created with
a prior release of Kerberos 5, you can upgrade it to work with the
current release with the `kdb5_util' command.  It is only necessary to
perform this dump/undump procedure if you were running a krb5-1.0.x KDC
and are migrating to a krb5-1.1.x or newer KDC.  The process for
upgrading a Master KDC involves the following steps:

  1. Stop your current KDC and administration server processes, if any.

  2. Dump your existing Kerberos database to an ASCII file with
     `kdb5_util''s "dump" command:

          shell% cd /usr/local/var/krb5kdc
          shell% kdb5_util dump old-kdb-dump
          shell% kdb5_util dump -ov old-kdb-dump.ov
          shell%

  3. Create a new Master KDC installation (*Note Install the Master
     KDC::).  If you have a stash file for your current database,
     choose any new master password but then copy your existing stash
     file to the location specified by your kdc.conf; if you do not
     have a stash file for your current database, you must choose the
     same master password.

  4. Load your old Kerberos database into the new system with
     `kdb5_util''s "load" command:

          shell% cd /usr/local/var/krb5kdc
          shell% kdb5_util load old-kdb-dump
          shell% kdb5_util load -update old-kdb-dump.ov
          shell%


The "dump -ov" and "load -update" commands are necessary in order to
preserve per-principal policy information, since the dump format in
releases prior to 1.2.2 filters out that information.  If you omit those
steps, the loaded database database will lose the policy information for
each principal that has a policy.

To update a Slave KDC, you must stop the old server processes on the
Slave KDC, install the new server binaries, reload the most recent slave
dump file, and re-start the server processes.

* Upgrading to Triple-DES Encryption Keys::


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Upgrading to Triple-DES Encryption Keys,  Prev: Upgrading Existing Kerberos V5 Installations,  Up: Upgrading Existing Kerberos V5 Installations

Upgrading to Triple-DES Encryption Keys
=======================================

Beginning with the 1.2 release from MIT, Kerberos includes a stronger
encryption algorithm called "triple DES" - essentially, three
applications of the basic DES encryption algorithm, greatly increasing
the resistance to a brute-force search for the key by an attacker.  This
algorithm is more secure, but encryption is much slower.  We expect to
add other, faster encryption algorithms at some point in the future.

Release 1.1 had some support for triple-DES service keys, but with
release 1.2 we have added support for user keys and session keys as
well.  Release 1.0 had very little support for multiple cryptosystems,
and some of that software may not function properly in an environment
using triple-DES as well as plain DES.

Because of the way the MIT Kerberos database is structured, the KDC will
assume that a service supports only those encryption types for which
keys are found in the database.  Thus, if a service has only a
single-DES key in the database, the KDC will not issue tickets for that
service that use triple-DES session keys; it will instead issue only
single-DES session keys, even if other services are already capable of
using triple-DES.  So if you make sure your application server software
is updated before adding a triple-DES key for the service, clients
should be able to talk to services at all times during the updating
process.

Normally, the listed `supported_enctypes' in `kdc.conf' are all used
when a new key is generated.  You can control this with command-line
flags to `kadmin' and `kadmin.local'.  You may want to exclude
triple-DES by default until you have updated a lot of your application
servers, and then change the default to include triple-DES.  We
recommend that you always include `des-cbc-crc' in the default list.

Bug Reports for Kerberos V5
***************************

In any complex software, there will be bugs.  If you have successfully
built and installed Kerberos V5, please use the `krb5-send-pr' program
to fill out a Problem Report.

Bug reports that include proposed fixes are especially welcome.  If you
do include fixes, please send them using either context diffs or unified
diffs (using `diff -c' or `diff -u', respectively).  Please be careful
when using "cut and paste" or other such means to copy a patch into a
bug report; depending on the system being used, that can result in
converting TAB characters into spaces, which makes applying the patches
more difficult.

The `krb5-send-pr' program is installed in the directory
`/usr/local/sbin'.

The `krb5-send-pr' program enters the problem report into our Problem
Report Management System (PRMS), which automatically assigns it to the
engineer best able to help you with problems in the assigned category.

The `krb5-send-pr' program will try to intelligently fill in as many
fields as it can.  You need to choose the "category", "class",
"severity", and "priority" of the problem, as well as giving us as much
information as you can about its exact nature.

The PR category will be one of:

     krb5-admin   krb5-appl    krb5-build   krb5-clients
     krb5-doc     krb5-kdc     krb5-libs    krb5-misc
     pty          telnet       test

Choose the category that best describes the area under which your
problem falls.

The class can be "sw-bug", "doc-bug", "change-request", or "support".
The first two are exactly as their names imply.  Use change-request
when the software is behaving according to specifications, but you want
to request changes in some feature or behavior.  The support class is
intended for more general questions about building or using Kerberos V5.

The severity of the problem indicates the problem's impact on the
usability of Kerberos V5.  If a problem is "critical", that means the
product, component or concept is completely non-operational, or some
essential functionality is missing, and no workaround is known.  A
"serious" problem is one in which the product, component or concept is
not working properly or significant functionality is missing.  Problems
that would otherwise be considered critical are rated serious when a
workaround is known.  A "non-critical" problem is one that is indeed a
problem, but one that is having a minimal effect on your ability to use
Kerberos V5.  E.g., The product, component or concept is working in
general, but lacks features, has irritating behavior, does something
wrong, or doesn't match its documentation.  The default severity is
serious.

The priority indicates how urgent this particular problem is in
relation to your work.  Note that low priority does not imply low
importance.  A priority of "high" means a solution is needed as soon as
possible.  A priority of "medium" means the problem should be solved no
later than the next release.  A priority of "low" means the problem
should be solved in a future release, but it is not important to your
work how soon this happens.  The default priority is medium.

Note that a given severity does not necessarily imply a given priority.
For example, a non-critical problem might still have a high priority if
you are faced with a hard deadline.  Conversely, a serious problem might
have a low priority if the feature it is disabling is one that you do
not need.

It is important that you fill in the release field and tell us what
changes you have made, if any.

Bug reports that include proposed fixes are especially welcome.  If you
include proposed fixes, please send them using either context diffs
(`diff -c') or unified diffs (`diff -u').

Encryption Types and Salt Types
-------------------------------

Currently, Kerberos V5 supports only DES and triple-DES encryption.
The encoding types include `des-cbc-crc' and `des3-cbc-sha1'.  The
"salt" is additional information encoded within the key that tells what
kind of key it is.  The only salts that you will be likely to encounter
are:

   * "normal", which MIT recommends using for all of your Kerberos V5
     keys

   * "v4", which is necessary only for compatibility with a v4 KDC or a
     v4 version of `kinit', and then only with `des-cbc-crc' encryption

   * "afs", which you will never need to generate, and which you will
     encounter only if you dump an AFS database into a Kerberos database

Support for additional encryption types is planned in the future.
