.Sh NAME
.Nm ac
.Nd display connect time accounting
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ac
.Op Fl dp
.Op Fl w Ar file
.Op Ar users ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
If the file
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
exists,
a record of system event and individual login and logout times are written
to it by
.Xr init 8
and
.Xr login 8 .
The program
.Nm ac
examines these
records and writes the accumulated connect time for individual logins to
the standard output.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width people
.It Fl d
Display the connect times in 24 hour periods.
.It Fl p
Display individual user totals.
.It Fl w Ar file
Read raw connect time data from
.Ar file
instead of the default file
.Pa /var/log/wtmp .
.El
.Pp
If
.Ar user
arguments are specified,
information is given for only those users.
Otherwise,
.Nm ac
displays information for all users for which there is data.
.Pp
The
.Pa wtmp
file will grow forever,
and therefore must be periodically truncated.
This is normally done by the daemon script
.Pa /etc/monthly ,
(scheduled by
.Xr cron 8 ),
which renames and rotates the
.Pa wtmp
files before truncating them (retaining about six month's worth).
No information is collected however,
if the
.Pa wtmp
file does not exist.
.Pp
All users are presumed to have logged out if the system shuts down
or reboots.
.Pp
Any logout records without preceding login records are ignored,
thus user sessions starting before the raw data begins will not
be included in the report.
For this reason, 
.Nm ac
may not correctly present data for users that were logged in when
the
.Pa wtmp
files were rotated.
To obtain correct data, either 
request data on a per-day basis (the
.Fl d
option) or concatenate multiple log files together in their creation
order and run
.Nm ac
on the result.
.Pp
Any login records without subsequent logout records when the raw data ends
will be treated as if the user logged out at midnight of the last day for
which there is any login record,
or as of the current time-of-day,
whichever is earlier.
