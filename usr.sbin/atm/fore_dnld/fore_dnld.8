.SH NOTES
.PP
Microcode as distributed by FORE Systems is not ready for downloading
directly into SBA host ATM adapters. Instead, the supplied microcode needs
to be processed with the "objcopy" command to create an image suitable
for downloading. Arguments to "objcopy" are "-S -l -Fcoff". Microcode as
distibuted by FORE Systems for the PCA host ATM adapter does not need
to be processed.
