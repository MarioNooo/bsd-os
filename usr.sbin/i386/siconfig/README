This is the BSDI 1.0 driver for the Specialix/SLXOS range of asynchronous
multiplexor controllers. Only the ISA version is currrently supported.
The SLXOS mux is an intelligent PC-bus card with Zilog Z280 CPU. Ports
are attached using out-board terminal adapters in 8-port chunks. Up to
32 ports (4 TA) can be driven by one controller. The driver will
support two controllers.

The driver has been tested on the following controller/TA configurations:

	SI Host 1.?	8 TA ports
	SI Plus 2.0	8 TA ports
	XIO-H		32 MTA ports

The driver source is in <src>/sys/i386/isa and a configuration utility
(siconfig) is in <src>/sys/sbin/siconfig. Sbin is used rather than /usr/sbin
as the driver must be configured before netstart is called if a SLXOS
port is used for PPP. Other directories on this distribution are for
updated manual pages and an updated MAKEDEV.
