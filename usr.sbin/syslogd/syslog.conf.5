.Sh NAME
.Nm syslog.conf
.Nd
.Xr syslogd 8
configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm syslog.conf
file is the configuration file for the
.Xr syslogd 8
program.
It consists of lines with two fields: a
.Em selectors
field, which specifies the types of messages and priorities to which the
line applies, and an
.Em action
field, which specifies the action to be taken if a message
.Xr syslogd
receives matches the selection criteria.
The
.Em selectors
field is separated from the
.Em action
field by one or more white space (blank or tab) characters.
.Pp
The
.Em selectors
are encoded as a comma-separated list of
.Em facilities ,
a period (``.''), and a
.Em level
(occasionally called a
.Em priority
elsewhere,
though the latter is supposed to refer to a combined facility and level).
Both the
.Em facilities
and the
.Em level
are case insensitive.
.Pp
Each
.Em facility
describes the part of the system generating the message, and is one of
the following keywords: auth, authpriv, cron, daemon, ftp, kern, lpr, mail,
mark, news, syslog, user, uucp and local0 through local7.
These keywords (with the exception of mark) correspond to the
similar
.Dq Dv LOG_
values specified to the
.Xr openlog 3
and
.Xr syslog 3
library routines.
.Pp
The
.Em level
describes the severity of the message, and is a keyword from the
following ordered list (higher to lower): emerg, alert, crit, err,
warning, notice, info and debug.
These keywords correspond to the
similar
.Pq Dv LOG_
values specified to the
.Xr syslog
library routine.
.Pp
See
.Xr syslog 3
for a further descriptions of both the
.Em facility
and
.Em level
keywords and their significance.
.Pp
If a received message matches the specified
.Em facility
and is of the specified
.Em level
.Em (or a higher level) ,
the action specified in the
.Em action
field will be taken.
.Pp
Multiple
.Em selectors
may be specified for a single
.Em action
by separating them with semicolon (``;'') characters.
It is important to note, however, that each
.Em selector
can modify the ones preceding it.
.Pp
An asterisk (``*'') can be used to specify all
.Em facilities
or all
.Em levels .
.Pp
The special
.Em facility
``mark'' receives a message at priority ``info'' every 20 minutes
(see
.Xr syslogd 8 ) .
This is not enabled by a
.Em facility
field containing an asterisk.
.Pp
The special
.Em level
``none'' disables a particular
.Em facility .
.Pp
The
.Em action
field of each line specifies the action to be taken when the
.Em selector
field selects a message.
There are four forms:
.Bl -bullet
.It
A pathname (beginning with a leading slash).
Selected messages are appended to the file.
.It
A hostname (preceded by an at (``@'') sign).
Selected messages are forwarded to the
.Dv syslog
port on the named host as defined in
.Pa /etc/services .
.It
A comma separated list of users.
Selected messages are written to those users
if they are logged in.
.It
An asterisk.
Selected messages are written to all logged-in users.
.El
.Pp
Blank lines are ignored.  Comments may start anywhere on a line, they
preceeded by a hash (``#'') character and continue to the end of line.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
A configuration file might appear as follows:
.Bd -literal
# Log all kernel messages, authentication messages of
# level notice or higher and anything of level err or
# higher to the console.
# Don't log private authentication messages!
*.err;kern.*;auth.notice;authpriv.none	/dev/console

# Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
# Don't log private authentication messages!
*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none		/var/log/messages

# The authpriv file has restricted access.
authpriv.*						/var/log/secure

# Log all the mail messages in one place.
mail.*							/var/log/maillog

# Everybody gets emergency messages, plus log them on another
# machine.
*.emerg							*
*.emerg							@arpa.berkeley.edu

# Root and Eric get alert and higher messages.
*.alert							root,eric

# Save mail and news errors of level err and higher in a
# special file.
uucp,news.crit						/var/log/spoolerr

.El
.Sh BUGS
The effects of multiple selectors are sometimes not intuitive.
For example ``mail.crit;*.err'' will select ``mail'' facility messages at
the level of ``err'' or higher, not at the level of ``crit'' or higher.
