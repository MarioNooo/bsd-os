.Sh NAME
.Nm date
.Nd display or set date and time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm date
.Op Fl nu
.Op Fl d Ar dst
.Op Fl r Ar seconds
.Op Fl t Ar minutes_west
.Op Cm + Ns Ar format
.Op [[[[yyyy]mm]dd]hh]mm[\&.ss]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Date
displays the current date and time when invoked without arguments.
Providing arguments will format the date and time in a user-defined
way or set the date.
Only the superuser may set the date.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Set the kernel's value for daylight savings time.
If
.Ar dst
is non-zero, future calls
to
.Xr gettimeofday 2
will return a non-zero
.Ql tz_dsttime  .
.It Fl n
The utility
.Xr timed 8
is used to synchronize the clocks on groups of machines.
By default, if
.Xr timed
is running,
.Nm date
will set the time on all of the machines in the local group.
The
.Fl n
option stops
.Nm date
from setting the time for other than the current machine.
.It Fl r
Use the date and time given, in
.Ar seconds
from the Epoch, instead of the current time.
.It Fl t
Set the kernel's value for minutes west of
.Tn GMT .
.Ar Minutes_west
specifies the number of minutes returned in
.Ql tz_minuteswest  
by future calls to
.Xr gettimeofday 2 .
.It Fl u
Display or set the date in
.Tn UCT
(universal) time.
.El
.Pp
An operand with a leading plus (``+'') sign signals a user-defined format
string which specifies the format in which to display the date and time.
The format string may contain any of the conversion specifications described
in the 
.Xr strftime 3
manual page, as well as any arbitrary text.
A <newline> character is always output after the characters specified by
the format string.
The format string for the default display is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y
.Ed
.Pp
If an operand does not have a leading plus sign, it is interpreted as
a value for setting the system's notion of the current date and time.
The canonical representation for setting the date and time is:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Ar yyyy
The year as a four-digit number.
Valid dates are from 1900 onward.
.br
For compatibility with the historic
.Nm date
command-line interface, a two-digit abbreviated form of the year may be
specified instead of the full four digits
(e.g., 89 for 1989, 00 for 2000, and 10 for 2010).
Valid abbreviated dates are from 1970 through 2069.
.It Ar mm
Numeric month.
A number from 1 to 12.
.It Ar dd
Day, a number from 1 to 31.
.It Ar hh
Hour, a number from 0 to 23.
.It Ar mm
Minutes, a number from 0 to 59.
.It Ar .ss
Seconds, a number from 0 to 61 (59 plus a a maximum of two leap seconds).
.El
.Pp
Everything but the minutes is optional.
.Pp
Time changes for Daylight Saving and Standard time and leap seconds
and years are handled automatically.
.Pp
Changes in the system time are logged to the
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
file; see
.Xr wtmp 5
for more information.
.Pp
The
.Nm date
utility exits 0 on success, 1 if unable to set the date, and 2 if able to
set the local date, but unable to set it globally.
.Pp
Occasionally, when
.Xr timed
synchronizes the time on many hosts, the setting of a new time value may
require more than a few seconds.
On these occasions,
.Nm date
writes	
.Ql Network time being set .
When the communication
between
.Nm date
and
.Xr timed
fails, the message
.Ql Communication error with timed
is written.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
date +"DATE: %m/%d/%y%nTIME: %H:%M:%S"
.Ed
.Pp
will display:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
DATE: 11/21/87
TIME: 13:36:16
.Ed
.Pp
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
date 8506131627
.Ed
.Pp
sets the date to June 13, 1985, 4:27 PM.
.Pp
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
date 1432
.Ed
.Pp
sets the time to
.Li "2:32 PM" ,
without modifying the date.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm date :
.Bl -tag -width "\&XXX"
.It Ev TZ
The time zone to use when displaying dates.
See
.Xr environ 7
for more information.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/messages -compact
.It Pa /var/log/wtmp
A record of date resets and time changes.
.It Pa /var/log/messages
A record of the user setting the time.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gettimeofday 2 ,
.Xr strftime 3 ,
.Xr utmp 5 ,
.Xr timed 8 ,
.Xr xntpd 8
.Sh BUGS
For security reasons,
the system won't permit
.Nm date
to set the time to an earlier time
than the current time if the security level is greater than zero.
On most systems, that means that the date must be set
in single user mode.
See
.Xr gettimeofday 2 .
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm date
command is expected to be compatible with
.St -p1003.2 .
