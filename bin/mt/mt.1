.Sh NAME
.Nm mt
.Nd magnetic tape manipulating program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mt
.Op Fl f Ar tapename
.Ar command
.Op Ar count | Ar length
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Mt
is used to give commands to a magnetic tape drive.
.Pp
For commands with associated counts,
operations may be performed multiple times by specifying a
.Ar count  .
By default,
.Nm mt
performs the requested operation once.
.Pp
The
.Ar tapename
argument must reference a raw (not block) tape device.
.Pp
The available commands are listed below.
Only as many characters as are required to uniquely identify a command
need be specified.
.Bl -tag -width "blocksize"
.It Cm blocksize
Set block 
.Ar length
for fixed length records.
If no
.Ar length
is specified the current value will be reported.
This command is only useful on Exabyte and DDS (dat data storage) SCSI drives.
.It Cm bsf
Back space
.Ar count
files.
.It Cm bsr
Back space
.Ar count
records.
.It Cm buffered
Enable data buffering in the physical tape drive.  When data buffering
is enabled, and the physical end of media is detected,
the drive may be unable to write all the buffered data to physical
media. Few programs count on end of media detection, so this
is unlikely to be a problem.
Currently
only SCSI tape drives are affected by this command.  This command
updates NVRAM in the physical tape drive, and is therefore very
sticky, even across a reboot or power cycle.
.It Cm eof , weof
Write
.Ar count
end-of-file marks at the current position on the tape.
.It Cm fsf
Forward space
.Ar count
files.
.It Cm fsr
Forward space
.Ar count
records.
.It Cm offline , rewoffl
Rewind the tape and place the tape unit off-line.
The
.Ar count
argument is ignored.
.It Cm rewind
Rewind the tape.
The
.Ar count
argument is ignored.
.It Cm status
Print status information about the tape unit.
The
.Ar count
argument is ignored.
.It Cm unbuffered
Disable data buffering in the physical tape drive. 
Currently
only SCSI tape drives are affected by this command.  This command
updates NVRAM in the physical tape drive, and is therefore 
sticky even across a reboot or power cycle.
.It Cm eof , weof
.El
.Pp
If a tape name is not specified, and the environment variable
.Ev TAPE
does not exist;
.Nm mt
uses the device
.Pa /dev/nrst0 .
.Pp
.Nm Mt
returns a 0 exit status when the operation(s) were successful,
1 if the command was unrecognized, and 2 if an operation failed.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If the following environment variable exists, it is utilized by
.Nm mt .
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ev TAPE
.Nm Mt
checks the
.Ev TAPE
environment variable if the argument
.Ar tapename
is not given.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/rstxxx -compact
.It Pa /dev/rst*
SCSI tape devices.
.It Pa /dev/nrst*
No-rewind SCSI tape devices.

.Xr dd 1 ,
.Xr ioctl 2 ,
.Xr st 4 ,
.Xr environ 7
.Sh BUGS
The stickiness of 
.Cm buffered
and 
.Cm unbuffered
could lead to unexpected behavior if 
.Nm mt
is not always used to set the drive in the expected mode.
.Pp
The 
.Xr wt 4
driver does not pay attention to
.Cm buffered 
or
.Cm unbuffered
and always run in buffered mode.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm mt
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
