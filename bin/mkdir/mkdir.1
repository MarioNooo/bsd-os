.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mkdir
.Nd make directories
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mkdir
.Op Fl p
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Ar directory_name  ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Mkdir
creates the directories named as operands, in the order specified,
using mode
.Li a=rwx Pq \&0777
as modified by the current
file mode creation mask
.Pq Xr umask 2 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl m
Set the mode bits of the final created directory to
the specified
.Ar mode .
The file mode creation mask applies to the mode.
The mode argument can be in any of the formats specified to the
.Xr chmod 1
command.
If a symbolic mode is specified, the operation characters
.Dq +
and
.Dq -
are interpreted relative to an initial mode of
.Dq a=rwx .
.It Fl p
Create intermediate directories as required.
If this option is not specified, the full path prefix of each
operand must already exist.
Intermediate directories are created with permission bits of
.Li a=rwx Pq \&0777
as modified by the current file mode creation mask,
plus write and search permission for the owner.
.El
.Pp
The user must have write permission in the parent directory.
.Pp
.Nm Mkdir
exits 0 if successful, and >0 if an error occurred.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rmdir 1 ,
.Xr umask 1
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm mkdir
utility is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
.Sh BUGS
You can't set the sticky, setuid or setgid bits
on a directory using
.Nm mkdir .
This behavior may change in future releases.
