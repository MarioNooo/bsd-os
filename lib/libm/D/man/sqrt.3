.Sh NAME
.Nm cbrt ,
.Nm cbrtf ,
.Nm sqrt ,
.Nm sqrtf
.Nd cube root and square root functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn cbrt "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn cbrtf "float x"
.Ft double
.Fn sqrt "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn sqrtf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cbrt
and
.Fn cbrtf
functions compute
the cube root of
.Ar x .
.Pp
The
.Fn sqrt
and
.Fn sqrtf
functions compute the
non-negative square root of x.
For a discussion of error reporting, see
.Xr math 3 .
.Sh ERRORS
For
.Fn sqrt
or
.Fn sqrtf ,
if
.Li "x < 0
then:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width _POSIX_\0 -compact
.It Dv _IEEE_
The return value is
.Li NaN .
.It Dv _POSIX_
Same as
.Dv _IEEE_ ,
but
.Va errno
is also set to
.Dv EDOM .
.It Dv _XOPEN_
Same as
.Dv _POSIX_ ,
but
.Va errno
is only set if
.Xr matherr 3
returns 0.
The exception type is
.Dv DOMAIN .
.It Dv _SVID_
Same as
.Dv _XOPEN_ ,
but the return value is 0,
and a message is printed to
.Va stderr
if
.Va errno
is set.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS

.Nm sqrt
function conforms to
.St -ansiC .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm cbrt
function appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
