.Sh DESCRIPTION
The functions
.Fn j0 ,
.Fn j0f ,
.Fn j1
and
.Fn j1f
compute the
.Em Bessel function of the first kind of the order
0 and the
.Em order
1, respectively,
for the
real value
.Fa x ;
the functions
.Fn jn
and
.Fn jnf
compute the
.Em Bessel function of the first kind of the integer
.Em order
.Fa n
for the real value
.Fa x .
.Pp
The functions
.Fn y0 ,
.Fn y0f ,
.Fn y1 ,
and
.Fn y1f
compute the linearly independent
.Em Bessel function of the second kind of the order
0 and the
.Em order
1, respectively,
for the
positive
.Em real
value
.Fa x ;
the functions
.Fn yn
and
.Fn ynf
compute the
.Em Bessel function of the second kind for the integer
.Em order
.Fa n
for the positive 
.Em real
value
.Fa x .
.Sh ERRORS
For
.Fn y0 ,
.Fn y0f ,
.Fn y1 ,
.Fn y1f ,
.Fn yn ,
or
.Fn ynf ,
if
.Li "x \(<= 0
then:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width _POSIX_\0 -compact
.It Dv _IEEE_
The return value is
.Li \-Inf
if
.Li "x = 0" ,
or
.Li NaN
if
.Li "x < 0" .
.It Dv _POSIX_
The return value is
.Li \-Inf ,
and
.Va errno
is set to
.Dv EDOM .
.It Dv _XOPEN_
Same as
.Dv _POSIX_ ,
but
.Va errno
is only set if
.Xr matherr 3
returns 0.
The exception type is
.Dv DOMAIN .
.It Dv _SVID_
Same as
.Dv _XOPEN_ ,
but the return value is
.Dv -MAXFLOAT ,
and a message is printed to
.Va stderr
if
.Va errno
is set.
.El
.Pp
If the magnitude of
.Li x
would lead to a result with a total loss of significance, then:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width _POSIX_\0 -compact
.It Dv _IEEE_
The return value is 0.
.It Dv _POSIX_
Same as
.Dv _IEEE_ ,
but
.Va errno
is also set to
.Dv ERANGE .
.It Dv _XOPEN_
Same as
.Dv _POSIX_ ,
but
.Va errno
is only set if
.Xr matherr 3
returns 0.
The exception type is
.Dv TLOSS .
.It Dv _SVID_
Same as
.Dv _XOPEN_ ,
and a message is printed to
.Va stderr
if
.Va errno
is set.
