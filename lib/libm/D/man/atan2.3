.Sh NAME
.Nm atan2 ,
.Nm atan2f
.Nd arc tangent functions of two variables
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn atan2 "double y" "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn atan2f "float y" "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn atan2
and the
.Fn atan2f
functions compute the principal value of the arc tangent of
.Fa y/ Ns Ar x ,
in the range
.Bk -words
.Bq \&- Ns \*(Pi , \&+ Ns \*(Pi
.Ek
radians,
using the signs of both arguments to determine the quadrant of
the return value.
For a discussion of error reporting, see
.Xr math 3 .
.Sh ERRORS
If
.Li "x = 0
and
.Li "y = 0
then:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width _POSIX_\0 -compact
.It Dv _IEEE_
The return value is 0.
.It Dv _POSIX_
Same as
.Dv _IEEE_ ,
but
.Va errno
is also set to
.Dv EDOM .
.It Dv _XOPEN_
Same as
.Dv _POSIX_ ,
but
.Va errno
is only set if
.Xr matherr 3
returns 0.
The exception type is
.Dv DOMAIN .
.It Dv _SVID_
Same as
.Dv _XOPEN_ ,
and a message is printed to
.Va stderr
if
.Va errno
is set.
