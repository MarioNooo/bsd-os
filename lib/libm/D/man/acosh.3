.Sh NAME
.Nm acosh ,
.Nm acoshf
.Nd inverse hyperbolic cosine functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn acosh "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn acoshf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acosh
and the 
.Fn acoshf
functions compute the inverse hyperbolic cosine
of the real
argument
.Ar x .
For a discussion of error reporting, see
.Xr math 3 .
.Sh ERRORS
If
.Li "\&|x| < 1
then:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width _POSIX_\0 -compact
.It Dv _IEEE_
The return value is
.Li NaN .
.It Dv _POSIX_
Same as
.Dv _IEEE_ ,
and
.Va errno
is also set to
.Dv EDOM .
.It Dv _XOPEN_
Same as
.Dv _POSIX_ ,
but
.Va errno
is only set if
.Xr matherr 3
returns 0.
The exception type is
.Dv DOMAIN .
.It Dv _SVID_
Same as
.Dv _XOPEN_ ,
and a message is printed to
.Va stderr
if
.Va errno
is set.
