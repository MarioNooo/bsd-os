.Sh NAME
.Nm fgetc ,
.Nm getc ,
.Nm getc_unlocked ,
.Nm getchar ,
.Nm getchar_unlocked ,
.Nm getw
.Nd get next character or word from input stream
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <stdio.h>
.Ft int
.Fn fgetc "FILE *stream"
.Ft int
.Fn getc "FILE *stream"
.Ft int
.Fn getc_unlocked "FILE *stream"
.Ft int
.Fn getchar void
.Ft int
.Fn getchar_unlocked void
.Ft int
.Fn getw "FILE *stream"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fgetc
function
obtains the next input character (if present) from the stream pointed at by
.Fa stream ,
or the next character pushed back on the stream via
.Xr ungetc .
.Pp
The
.Fn getc
function
acts identically to
.Fn fgetc .
.Pp
The
.Fn getchar
function
is equivalent to
.Fn getc 
with the argument stdin.
.Pp
The
.Fn getw
function
obtains the next
.Em int
(if present)
from the stream pointed at by
.Fa stream .
.Pp
The
.Fn getc_unlocked
and
.Fn getchar_unlocked
are equivalent to 
.Fn getc
and
.Fn getchar
respectively except that they
are expanded in-line and
are not implemented in a thread-safe manner.
They are intended for use with
.Fn flockfile 
and 
.Fn funlockfile
which provide thread-safe synchronization.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, these routines return the next requested object
from the
.Fa stream .
If the stream is at end-of-file or a read error occurs,
the routines return
.Dv EOF .
The routines
.Xr feof 3
and
.Xr ferror 3
must be used to distinguish between end-of-file and error.
If an error occurs, the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
The end-of-file condition is remembered, even on a terminal, and all
subsequent attempts to read will return
.Dv EOF
until the condition is cleared with
.Xr clearerr .
.Pp
Note that
.Dv EOF
is negative,
while input characters returned by the
.Fn getc
family of functions are first strained through the
.Ft "unsigned char"
type, so that
.Dv EOF
is distinct from all possible input characters.
Storing the return value in a
.Ft char
variable will lose this distinction, however,
and should therefore be done only after comparison against
.Dv EOF .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ferror 3 ,
.Xr fread 3 ,
.Xr fopen 3 ,
.Xr putc 3 ,
.Xr ungetc 3 ,
.Xr pthreads 3 ,
.Xr flockfile 3 ,
.Xr funlockfile 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn fgetc ,
.Fn getc
and
.Fn getchar
functions
conform to
.St -ansiC .
.Pp
The
.Nm getc_unlocked
and
.Nm getchar_unlocked
functions conform to
.St -p1003.1c .
.Sh BUGS
Since
.Dv EOF
is a valid integer value,
.Xr feof
and
.Xr ferror
must be used to check for failure after calling
.Fn getw .
The size and byte order of an
.Em int
varies from one machine to another, and
.Fn getw
is not recommended for portable applications.
