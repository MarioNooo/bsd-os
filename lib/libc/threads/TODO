Projects:

- Look at requirements for SYSCONF stuff and Unistd.h.
- Update the select stubs in the threads code to use the new 
  POSIX 1.g select code.
- Generalize the "monitor" code used in the thread kernel 
  and make it available for use in other places.
- Make the kernel monitor lock recursize (i.e. same thread
  can re-enter monitor.)
- Add PSHARED support to objects that allow it.
  This includes mutexes, condition variables and semaphores (when implemented).
- Add additional support from POSIX 1.j.
  I.e. Barriers, pthread spinlocks (look at machine/threads/machdep_sync.s).
  rwlocks, etc.  In particular rwlocks might be used to good effect in a 
  number of places in libc.
- Add examples to the man pages.
