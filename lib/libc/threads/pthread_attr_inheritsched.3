.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread_attr_getinheritsched ,
.Nm pthread_attr_setinheritsched
.Nd pthread inheritsched creation attribute
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <pthread.h>
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_attr_getinheritsched "pthread_attr_t *attr" "int *inheritsched"
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_attr_setinheritsched "pthread_attr_t *attr" "int inheritsched"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
This interface is defined by
.St -p1003.1c .
.Pp
The 
.Fn pthread_attr_getinheritsched
and
.Fn pthread_attr_setinheritsched
functions retrieve and establish the
.Fa inheritsched
attribute in the pthread creation attribute pointed to by
.Fa attr .
The 
.Fa inheritsched 
value should be specified as one of
.Dv PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED 
or
.Dv PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED .
The default value for 
.Fa inheritsched 
in an attribute object is
.Dv PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED .
.Pp
Specifying 
.Dv PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED 
causes all threads created with the creation attribute
.Fa attr 
to be created with the scheduling attributes of the parent thread.
The scheduling attributes in this attribute object are ignored.
.Pp
Specifying 
.Dv PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED
causes all threads created with the creation attribute
.Fa attr 
to establish their scheduling attributes from those set
in the
.Fa attr
attribute object, ignoring those of the parent thread.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Nm pthread_attr_getinheritsched
and
.Nm pthread_attr_setinheritsched
functions both return 0.  A non-zero result indicates
an error occurred.

.Nm pthread_attr_getinheritsched
and
.Nm pthread_attr_setinheritsched
functions may fail and return the following error:
