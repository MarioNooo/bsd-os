.Sh NAME
.Nm pthreads
.Nd POSIX 1003.1c standard threads API.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <pthread.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The pthreads API provides a 
.St -p1003.1c
standard interface implementing multiple threads of execution within
a traditional user process.  This implementation is currently
user-space only. 
.Nm Pthreads 
provides functions for thread creation and destruction, an interface
to the thread scheduler to establish thread scheduling parameters,
and mutex and condition variables to provide mechanisms for the 
programmer to synchronize access to shared process resources.
.Pp
The
.Nm pthreads
library routines are a part of the C library.
The
.Nm pthreads
system is automatically initialized when a program
calls
.Fn pthread_create 
to instantiate a thread.
.Pp
The
.Tn SYNOPSIS
sections of the following manual pages indicate which include files
are to be used, what the compiler declaration for the function
looks like and which external variables are of interest.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm pthreads
library conforms to
.St -p1003.1c .
