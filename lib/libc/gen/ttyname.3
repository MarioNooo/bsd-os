.Dt TTYNAME 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ttyname ,
.Nm ttyname_r ,
.Nm isatty ,
.Nm ttyslot
.Nd get name of associated terminal (tty) from file descriptor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft char *
.Fn ttyname "int fd"
.Ft int
.Fn ttyname_r "int fd" "char *buf" "size_t size"
.Ft int
.Fn isatty "int fd"
.Ft int
.Fn ttyslot void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions operate on the system file descriptors for terminal
type devices. These descriptors are not related to the standard
.Tn I/O
.Dv FILE
typedef, but refer to the special device files found in
.Pa /dev
and named
.Pa /dev/tty Ns Em xx
and for which an entry exists
in the initialization file
.Pa /etc/ttys.
(See
.Xr ttys 5 . )
.Pp
The
.Fn isatty
function
determines if the file descriptor
.Fa fd
refers to a valid
terminal type device.
.Pp
The
.Fn ttyname
function
gets the related device name of
a file descriptor for which
.Fn isatty
is true.
.Pp
The
.Fn ttyname_r
function is a reentrant version of the traditional
.Fn ttyname
function that fills in a supplied buffer
.Fa buf
of the given
.Fa size ,
which should be at least
.Dv TTY_NAME_MAX
characters long.
.Pp
The
.Fn ttyslot
function
fetches the current process' control terminal number from the
.Xr ttys 5
file entry.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn ttyname
function
returns the null terminated name if the device is found and
.Fn isatty
is true; otherwise 
a
.Dv NULL
pointer is returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn ttyname_r
function returns 0 on success,
or the reason for failure (see ERRORS).
(In no case is the global variable
.Va errno
changed.)
.Pp
The
.Fn ttyslot
function
returns the unit number of the device file if found; otherwise
the value zero is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width ERANGEXX
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa fd
argument to
.Fn ttyname
or
.Fn ttyname_r
is invalid.
.It Bq Er ENOTTY
The
.Fa fd
argument to
.Fn ttyname
or
.Fn ttyname_r
does not refer to a tty.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
While the
.Fa fd
argument to
.Fn ttyname
or
.Fn ttyname_r
appears to refer to a tty, no name could be found for it.
.It Bq Er ERANGE
The buffer supplied to
.Fn ttyname_r
is too small to hold the name.
(That is, the supplied
.Fa size
does not provide sufficient room.)
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/ttys -compact

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn isatty ,
.Fn ttyname ,
and
.Fn ttyslot
functions appeared in
.At v7 .
The
.Fn ttyname ,
.Fn ttyname_r
and
.Fn isatty
functions conform to
.St -p1003.1-96 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fn ttyname
function leaves its result in an internal static object and returns
a pointer to that object. Subsequent calls to
.Fn ttyname
will modify the same object.
.Pp
The 
.Fn ttyname ,
.Fn isatty ,
and
.Fn ttyslot
functions may not be safely called concurrently from multiple 
threads, e.g., the interfaces described by 
.Fn pthreads 3 .
